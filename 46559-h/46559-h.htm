<h2>DEDICATION.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>TO THE LEARNED SOCIETIES OF ENGLAND, WHO HAVE
FAVOURED WITH THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT THE
JOURNEY OF M. HENRI MOUHOT TO THE REMOTE
LANDS OF SIAM, LAOS, AND CAMBODIA.</p></div>


<p>I trust that the members of those scientific societies who kindly
supported and encouraged my brother in his travels and labours,
will receive favourably the documents collected by the family of
the intrepid traveller, whom death carried off in the flower of his
age, in the midst of his discoveries.</p>

<p>Had he been able to accomplish fully the end at which he
aimed, it would certainly have been to you that he would have
offered the fruits of his travels: he would have felt it his first
duty to testify his gratitude and esteem to the worthy representatives
of science in that great, free, and generous English
nation who adopted him. Half English by his marriage, M.
Mouhot still preserved his love for his own country: there,
however, for various reasons he did not receive the encouragement
he anticipated, and it was on the hospitable soil of England
that he met with that aid and support, which not only her
scientific men, but the whole nation, delight in affording to
explorations in unknown countries, ever attended by perils and
hardships. The journal of the unfortunate traveller shows his
feelings of affection for the two countries which he loved
equally, and his devotion to science, art, and the progress of
civilization.</p>

<p>I therefore feel it an imperative duty to express to you and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the whole English nation the sentiments of gratitude to which
this good and loyal Frenchman so often gave utterance, while
engaged in the work to which he spontaneously devoted
himself, and in which he was sustained by your counsels and
assistance.</p>

<p>Receive therefore from Madame Mouhot and myself, as a
legacy left by her dear husband and my affectionate brother,
the expression of our gratitude; and accept the work, left
imperfect, it is true, but which we hope will prove how much
has been lost by the death of a brave man, who, allied to the
family of Mungo Park, met the same fate in the East that
that illustrious explorer did in Africa. M. Mouhot’s premature
end did not permit him to correct and arrange his journal,
which is an additional reason for claiming indulgence from
you, whose enlightened minds and generous benevolence will
know how to appreciate the circumstances under which this
posthumous work sees the light.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>As will be seen, this work is compiled from the
private letters of M. Mouhot to his family and
friends, and from his journal. I had also the
benefit of the paper destined by my brother for
the Archæological Society of London, on the interesting
ruins of Ongcor. Among the documents
which, thanks to the active kindness of Sir R.
Schomburgh, British Consul at Bangkok, of Dr.
Campbell, R.N., and of M. D’Istria, French Consul,
reached me as early as possible after my brother’s
death, I found valuable sketches and drawings,
together with various unfinished papers relative to
his different scientific researches in the countries
he had visited and in districts which had only
recently been brought into notice by the advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of commerce, and by the military expeditions
which had been sent to the extreme East.</p>

<p>The family of M. Mouhot were divided in
opinion as to the course to be adopted with regard
to these varied materials. Should they be kept
in a portfolio as a sacred but barren deposit, or
should they be arranged in the best manner possible
and laid before the public?</p>

<p>After grave consideration they yielded to the
representations of friends of the deceased, and to
myself was confided the painful but interesting
task of superintending the arrangement of the
notes, sketches, and documents for publication. I
accordingly set about it at once, under the first impressions
of grief at the loss I had sustained, and
guided only by fraternal love, for I lay no claim
to the title of author. I have simply classified the
masses of papers, the fruit of four years’ travel,
and added a few explanatory notes.</p>

<p>I have already stated the motives which induced
me to dedicate this work to the Savans of England,
more especially to those with whom my brother
was connected through science or literature.</p>

<p>Let me give a short sketch of the work for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which we claim the indulgence of the public. I
have first, preserving the chronological order,
divided the journal into chapters, inserting in
their appropriate places such portions of the private
letters as served to throw light on the subject.
This forms the body of the work.</p>

<p>In an Appendix I have inserted the Chinese
tales translated by the author during his residence
in Siam&mdash;some unfinished papers which are
only specimens of a zoological work which my
brother intended to publish&mdash;the descriptions of
the principal entomological and conchological specimens
discovered by him, and which are now
deposited in the Museums of London and Paris&mdash;the
Cambodian vocabulary, a proof of his industry,
of the variety of his knowledge, and of the care
with which he collected everything which might
be useful to his successors in the difficult path
which he opened to them.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have collected the letters of my brother
to his family and other correspondents, together
with some letters addressed to him, a few of which
were never even received, while others only reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
their destination after his death, or remained in the
hands of friends who were charged to deliver them.
This correspondence tends, I think, to display my
brother’s character, the delicacy of his mind, and
the goodness of his heart, qualities which have
been recognised by so many, both during his life
and after his death.</p>

<p>The engravings from his drawings will impart
interest to the descriptions of the ruins and vast
buildings which he discovered in the interior of
Siam and Cambodia, testifying to an advanced
state of civilization in former times, and which, I
venture to think, deserve to be brought into notice.
They will also familiarize the reader with the
manners, customs, and appearance of the country.
My aim has been to be useful to those who
deign to read these pages; and, if fidelity be
merit in a book, I trust the reader will be
satisfied.</p>

<p>Even should there be any errors in the numbers
of the population, and similar details concerning
the little-known countries which my brother traversed,
I beg the reader to view them with indul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>gence,
bearing in mind that most of this journal
was written in pencil, sent home from a long
distance, and some of it half effaced;&mdash;illegible,
indeed, to any one to whom his writing was not
as well known as it was to Madame Mouhot and
myself, and who were not as intimate with the
heart and thoughts of the writer.</p>

<p>All these reasons induce me to reckon on the
indulgence of the public.</p>

<p>The Memoir which follows was written by a
friend in Holland. The historical notice which
I have thus introduced, appeared to me useful,
in order to give a clearer idea of the country
which my brother has contributed to make better
known, and where he sealed with his death his
devotion to travel and scientific pursuits.</p>

<p>Let me add, in conclusion, that the family of
M. Mouhot gladly embrace the opportunity of
thanking publicly all those who have given aid
to the traveller, and have testified their friendship
for him; several are mentioned in the course of
the book by my brother himself, but others, from
whom he received equal kindness and support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
before embarking on his perilous journey into
unknown regions, have not perhaps been noticed
as they deserved. It was neither forgetfulness
nor ingratitude on his part; his death is his
excuse.</p>

<h2>MEMOIR OF M. HENRI MOUHOT.</h2>


<p>Alexander Henri Mouhot was born at Montbéliard
on 15th May, 1826, of parents not rich, but respectable.
His father occupied a subordinate post in the administration
under Louis Philippe and the Republic, and expended
nearly the whole of his salary in the education of his
two sons, even undergoing many privations for that purpose.
His mother, a teacher of considerable merit, whose
memory is held in respect by all who knew her, died
young, greatly through overwork and fatigue, incurred in
providing for the wants of her family and the education
of her children. Two months after the departure of her
son Henri for Russia&mdash;a separation which was heartbreaking
to her&mdash;she took to her bed, from which she never
rose again. This was in 1844. M. Mouhot first studied
philology in his own country, intending to become a
teacher; but before long a strong leaning for the natural
sciences, easy to be understood in the country of Cuvier
and of Laurillard, gave a new direction to his mind; and
this, with his ardent desire to see other countries, determined
his vocation. His first profession enabled him to
extend his researches, and while he perfected himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
science he continued to follow the arduous and thorny
path of the professor. Having a thorough knowledge of
his own language, and being a good Greek scholar, it was
not difficult for him to acquire with facility both Russian
and Polish during his stay in that vast northern empire,
which he traversed from St. Petersburgh to Sebastopol,
and from Warsaw to Moscow.</p>

<p>He began as a teacher, but soon became an artist,
after the discovery of Daguerre, which impressed him
strongly; he mastered its mechanical parts, and determined
to carry the new invention into foreign lands.
This afforded to him the means of an existence conformable
to his wishes. He soon made affectionate friends
in the highest classes of society in Russia; took out
his professor’s diploma there, and in that capacity was
admitted into several establishments, both public and private;
among others, to that of the cadets of Voronége,
&amp;c. Devoting himself in his hours of leisure, and at
night, to the cultivation of the arts and sciences, and
profiting by his visits to various towns and departments
of the empire, he constantly augmented his collection of
drawings and photographs, comprising landscapes illustrating
different parts of the country, portraits of distinguished
men, specimens from museums, and buildings in
the semi-Byzantine style, equally interesting to artists
and to archæologists.</p>

<p>He scrupulously refrained from politics, and fully appreciated
the difficulty of governing a country so immense,
and in which the manners, religion, and language differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
so much in its various parts; still he felt deeply the condition
of the serfs, a condition which Alexander II., moved
by generous sentiments, wishes now to reform. This state
of things made a painful impression on the heart of the
young Frenchman, and on his return to his own country
he gave vent to his feelings in a book called ‘Slavery in
Russia;’ and in order to engage better the attention of
the reader he wove it into the form of a novel, in which
he was enabled to employ the resources of illustration,
and to depict the manners of the country. This work,
however, which touched on many of the leading questions
of the day, was never published, and is only mentioned
here as an illustration of his generous feelings.</p>

<p>The war which broke out in the East induced him to
leave Russia, although, doubtless, owing to his numerous
friends, he might safely have awaited there the return of
a time more propitious to the cultivation of art and science;
but his feelings as a Frenchman revolted from this, and
he also felt that the gravity of the events about to take
place would turn every mind from all but warlike
subjects.</p>

<p>M. Mouhot, therefore, returned to France to his father
and to a loved brother, who became the companion of his
new travels in Germany, Belgium, and the north of Italy;
and everywhere they laboured by means of photography
to make known the works of the great masters and the
beauties of the country, exercising their profession like
real artists. They afterwards resolved to visit Holland,
where photography was less widely known than in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
countries. After staying there some time they removed
their establishment to England in 1856, the more willingly
as they had both married English ladies, relatives of
Mungo Park, and having friends willing to push on the
two young men, who, full of energy, possessed the qualities
necessary for success in an artistic or scientific career.
During some ensuing years the two brothers pursued their
calling together, and shared each other’s pleasures and
cares; but Henri afterwards found in a peaceful life at
Jersey an opportunity of resuming his studies in Natural
History, devoting himself particularly to Ornithology and
Conchology. These studies revived in him the desire for
foreign travel; and beautiful as was the island where he
lived&mdash;and where his time was divided between his home,
his books, and out-door pursuits&mdash;his thirst for knowledge
made him long for a wider field of research, and one less
explored by modern travellers. An English book on Siam
came into his possession about this time, as though sent
by the hand of destiny, and to visit that country became
the object of his aspirations. The great Geographical and
Zoological Societies of London, capable of appreciating the
man of merit, approved of his project, and aided him
efficaciously in its prosecution; and M. H. Mouhot quitted
his wife, brother, and all his friends and every advantage
of civilization, in order to visit, in the cause of science,
regions little known, but where, through much fatigue and
danger, the prospect of a glorious future opened itself
before him.</p>

<p>He was already well prepared for the life; active, strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and blessed with an excellent constitution: his physical
strength was beyond the average&mdash;a result of the gymnastic
sports in which he had taken pleasure in his youth,
and of his habitual sobriety. He had never had an attack
of fever, nor any other illness; and he resisted for four
years the effects of a tropical climate, incredible fatigue,
bad food, and nights passed in forests, without any apparent
loss of health or strength, which is doubtless to be attributed
to his never taking spirits, and wine only very
sparingly.</p>

<p>His intellectual and moral qualities did not seem less
to promise success; both a <i>savant</i> and an artist, he was
also an indefatigable hunter, and had a degree of kindness
mingled with his courage which was sure to gain the good-will
of the uncivilized people among whom he had to live.
In all these respects M. Mouhot fulfilled the expectations
of the savans of England and of his numerous friends, as
is evident by the rich collections made by him in so short
a time, by the cordial welcome which he met with throughout
his travels, by the respect paid to him by all learned
men, and by the unanimous feelings of regret at his death,
both in England and on the Continent. Although a Protestant,
he inspired sincere friendships among the Catholic
missionaries in Siam and the other countries he visited
from 1858 to 1861, friendships which are clearly shown
in his journal and letters.</p>

<p>We shall not say much about his travels; they form the
subject of this work, which, even in its unfinished state,
we trust will present much important information to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
geographer and archæologist, to the naturalist and linguist.
Many capable of judging have already hastened to pay
their tribute of praise to the traveller who has enriched
such various branches of science, and displayed to the
world the riches of the extreme East.</p>

<p>M. Mouhot dedicated the last four years of his life to
exploring the interior of Siam; he first travelled through
that country, then through Cambodia, and afterwards re-ascended
the Mekong as far as the frontiers of Laos;
visited one of the savage and independent tribes inhabiting
the district between those two countries and Cochin
China; then, after having crossed the great lake Touli-Sap,
he explored the provinces of Ongcor and Battambong,
where he discovered splendid ruins, especially the Temple
of Ongcor the Great, which is nearly perfect, and perhaps
unparalleled in the world.</p>

<p>Passing from the basin of the Mekong into that of the
Menam, he saw mountains of which the principal peak
was more than 6000 feet high. He returned occasionally
to Bangkok, the capital of Siam, in order to make preparations
for fresh expeditions. The loss, by the wreck
of the <i>Sir James Brooke</i>, of a very valuable collection, did
not discourage him; but he set about at once to replace it.
At the time of his death, which happened on 10th November,
1861, he was <i>en route</i> for the provinces south-west
of China, when, having already penetrated far into the
interior, he was attacked by the jungle fever, and died
after twenty-two days’ illness. His energetic mind, full of
the task he had to perform, remained clear to the end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and a few last words were written by him, his strength of
will overcoming his weakness.</p>

<p>He set out for Louang-Prabang on 15th October, and
on the 18th halted at H&mdash;&mdash; (the name is unfinished in
the manuscript); the next day he felt the first symptoms
of the fever to which he fell a victim. From the 29th
October he wrote nothing. The last words in the journal,
“Have pity on me, O my God,” show the religious principles
which had guided his life.</p>

<p>All that we know of his last days and his lamentable
end, was learned from his two native servants, who were
strongly attached to him; and through Sir R. Schomburgh,
the English Consul at Bangkok, and Dr. Campbell, Surgeon
R.N., who was attached to the British consulate,
and who returned shortly afterwards to England, when
he placed all the papers, notes, and drawings left by M.
Mouhot in the hands of his widow and of M. Charles
Mouhot, whose task it has been to arrange this legacy as
methodically as possible, considering the great difficulty
of finding the connecting links of his various descriptions.</p>

<p>The ‘Athenæum’ and the ‘Illustrated London News’<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
both inserted an account of the death of M. H. Mouhot;
and the latter journal justly designated his death as another
addition to the long list of martyrs to science. It likewise
gave a short sketch of the discoveries and scientific services
of this intrepid traveller.</p>

<p>Ornithology, entomology, and other branches of natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
history, were represented in the collection sent by M. Mouhot
to his agent, Mr. S. Stevens, of Bloomsbury Street,
London, and were the subject of several papers by Dr.
Gray, Dr. Gunter, Dr. Louis Pfeiffer, and other naturalists,
members of the Zoological Society of London, and published
in the ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History.’
At a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society on the
10th of March, 1862, Sir R. Murchison seized the occasion
of reading some letters from the traveller relating to the
topography of Cambodia, to pay a tribute of gratitude to
his merit as a zoological collector and explorer. “His
loss,” he observed, “will be much felt by men of science,
and a long time may elapse before another man will be
found bold enough to follow his steps in that country of
virgin forests and fever, and to the exploring of which he
sacrificed his home, his health, and his life.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens, in acquainting the brother of the traveller
with the fact of his having received a new zoological collection
which had been consigned to him, says, “I can
truly say that the insects and shells equal, if they do not
surpass, any in the most beautiful collections I have ever
received, and show clearly what a marvellously rich country
for the naturalist lies between Siam and Cochin-China.”
A splendid <i>scarabæus</i> was also sent to Mr. Stevens, who
remarks, that “this insect was described in the ‘Zoological
Review’ of Paris under the name of <i>Mouhotia gloriosa</i>, as
a mark of respect to the late M. Mouhot, and stated to be
one of the most magnificent known.”</p>

<p>The Society of Montbéliard hastened, on the first news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of his death, to write to his brother, and the letter contains
these words:&mdash;“His work was left unfinished, but it was
gloriously commenced, and his name will not perish!”</p>

<p>Amidst all these eulogiums of a life, short but well
spent, one of the most touching is a letter from M. Marie
Ch. Fontaine, missionary at Saigon in Cochin-China, who
was in Paris in August, 1862, and saw in a newspaper
the death of the man whom he had met in Siam and Cambodia,
which was soon confirmed by a letter from his
brother. This worthy missionary addressed to M. Charles
Mouhot a letter, of which the whole should be read; we
only extract the following passage:&mdash;“I learned, when on
my mission, the death of my father, and then that of my
mother. I assure you that these two cruel blows scarcely
made more impression on me than the news of the death
of a man whose equal I had not met with during the
twenty years that I have inhabited that country; and to
hear of his dying without any help, and having no one
near him but his servants throughout his illness, in a
country so barbarous, was more than sufficient to make
tears flow at the memory of this good and benevolent
friend. Be assured, my dear Sir, that my sentiments are
shared by all here who knew M. Mouhot. The natives
themselves must have felt regret at his loss, for all whom
he came near praised him for his behaviour towards them,
and his gentleness and generosity; qualities invaluable in
the eyes of that people.”</p>

<p>In a letter recently addressed by Sir R. Schomburgh to
M. C. Mouhot, enclosing the portraits of the King and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Queen of Siam, that gentleman thus expresses himself:&mdash;“I
admired the zeal and knowledge of your late brother;
and his manners were so amiable and modest that one
would have thought that every one with whom he came
in contact would have exercised all their influence to assist
him in his plans. I often regretted that he was not an
English subject, that I might have been able to do more
for him. I shall look impatiently for the publication of
his book, and have given orders that the French edition
may be forwarded to me at once.”</p>

<p>I can add nothing to these touching testimonies, which
paint faithfully the man as I knew him in Holland. The
affectionate heart of Henri Mouhot awakened in others
an affection which the tomb does not destroy, but which
grows stronger with time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">The Voyage&mdash;First Impressions of Siam; and of Bangkok, its
Capital&mdash;Reception in the Palace&mdash;The Two Kings of Siam.</span></p></div>


<p>On the 27th April, 1858, I embarked at London, in a
sailing ship of very modest pretensions, in order to put
in execution my long-cherished project of exploring the
kingdoms of Siam, Cambodia, and Laos, and visiting
the tribes who occupy the banks of the great river
Mekon.</p>

<p>I spare the reader the details of the voyage and of my
life on board ship, and shall merely state that there were
annoyances in plenty, both as regards the accommodation
for the passengers and the conduct of the captain, whose
sobriety was more than doubtful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SINGAPORE.</div>

<p>We arrived at Singapore on the 3rd September. The
census, taken in May, 1859, of the population of this
beautiful and flourishing settlement, gave the following
results.&mdash;Total, 81,792, of whom only 450 were Euro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>peans,
and 1995 Eurasians, or of a mixed race, such as
Indo-English, Indo-Portuguese, and Indo-Dutch. The
Chinese numbered 50,043, the Klings 11,735, and Malays
10,880; the women belonging to these races being computed
at no more than 3248, 963, and 3700 respectively.
The remainder of the population was composed of Bengalese
1236, Burmese and Siamese 14, Bugese 916,
Javanese 3408, and Arabs 117.</p>

<p>There are in the island 13 schools, 70 temples or
pagodas, 13 hotels and taverns, 26 pawnbrokers, 87 spirit-merchants,
144 houses licensed for opium-smoking, and
11 houses for the sale of a peculiar spirit unknown in
France, but which is extracted from rice, and known under
the name of arrack. The fishing-boats number 750.
Facilities for locomotion and traffic are provided by 589
public carriages, 1180 passenger-boats, and 600 carts for
the transport of merchandise.</p>

<p>In addition to the population of Singapore itself, the
islands in the immediate vicinity, and forming a part
of the settlement, contain 1500 inhabitants, making the
entire population of Singapore and its dependencies
nearly 83,000. I made only a short stay there, my chief
object being to gain information respecting the country
I was about to visit. On the 12th of the same month,
after a very monotonous voyage, we arrived at the mouth
of the river Menam, on whose banks Bangkok is built. A
vast sandbank here bars the entrance of large ships, and
compels them to go eight or nine miles farther up the
gulf, and discharge their cargoes at great additional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
expense. Our vessel, however, only drawing eight feet
of water, passed without much difficulty, and anchored
at Paknam in front of the Governor’s house, whither the
captain and myself proceeded without loss of time, in order
to obtain the necessary permission to continue our route.</p>

<p class="caption">VIEW IN THE GULF OF SIAM.</p>


</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PAKNAM&mdash;THE MENAM.</div>

<p>This formality over, I hastened to visit the forts, which
are of brick and battlemented, the markets, and some of
the streets. Paknam is the Sebastopol or Cronstadt of the
Kings of Siam; nevertheless, I fancied that a European
squadron could easily master it, and that the commander,
after breakfasting there, might dine the same day at
Bangkok.</p>

<p>On a little island in the middle of the river rises a
famous and rather remarkable pagoda, containing, I was
told, the bodies of their last kings. The effect of this
pyramidal structure reflected in the deep and limpid
water, with its background of tropical verdure, was most
striking. As for the town, all that I saw of it was disgustingly
dirty.</p>

<p>The Menam deserves its beautiful name&mdash;Mother of
Waters&mdash;for its depth permits the largest vessels to coast
along its banks without danger: so closely, indeed, that
the birds may be heard singing gaily in the overhanging
branches, and the hum of numberless insects enlivens the
deck by night and day. The whole effect is picturesque
and beautiful. Here and there houses are dotted about
on either bank, and numerous villages give variety to the
distant landscape.</p>

<p>We met a great number of canoes managed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
incredible dexterity by men and women, and often even
by children, who are here early familiarised with the water.
I saw the Governor’s children, almost infants, throw
themselves into the river, and swim and dive like water-fowl.
It was a curious and interesting sight, particularly
from the strong contrast between the little ones and the
adults. Here, as in the whole plain of Siam, which I
afterwards visited, I met most attractive children, tempting
one to stop and caress them; but as they grow older they
rapidly lose all beauty, the habit of chewing the betel-nut
producing an unsightly blackening of the teeth and
swelling of the lips.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BANGKOK.</div>

<p>It is impossible to state the exact population of Bangkok,
the census of all Eastern countries being extremely imperfect.
It is estimated, however, at from three to four
hundred thousand inhabitants. Owing to its semi-aquatic
site, we had reached the centre of the city while I
believed myself still in the country; I was only undeceived
by the sight of various European buildings, and the
steamers which plough this majestic river, whose margins
are studded with floating houses and shops.</p>

<p class="caption">GENERAL VIEW OF BANGKOK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bangkok is the Venice of the East, and whether bent
on business or pleasure you must go by water. In place
of the noise of carriages and horses, nothing is heard but
the dip of oars, the songs of sailors, or the cries of the
Cipayes (Siamese rowers). The river is the high street
and the boulevard, while the canals are the cross streets,
along which you glide, lying luxuriously at the bottom of
your canoe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>We cast anchor in front of the cathedral of the
French Mission and of the modest palace of Monseigneur
Pallegoix, the worthy archbishop, who, for nearly thirty
years, without any assistance but that of missionaries as
devoted as himself, has made the revered emblem of
Christianity and the name of France respected in these
distant regions.</p>

<p>The sight of the Cross in foreign lands speaks to the
heart like meeting with an old friend; one feels comforted
and no longer alone. It is beautiful to see the devotion,
self-denial, and courage of these poor and pious missionaries;
a blessing as they are, also, to travellers, it
would be ungrateful not to render them the gratitude
which is their just due.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOREIGN MERCHANTS.</div>

<p>For some time past, particularly since the wars in
China and Cochin-China, Siam has been much talked of
in Europe; and, relying on the faith of treaties of peace
and commerce, several French and English houses of
business have been established there. Unfortunately,
there was much deception on the part of the native authorities,
which has given rise to general and well-founded
complaints from the merchants. The fact is, that they
have dangerous competitors in the mandarins and even
in the princes, who monopolise the greater part of the
trade in rice and sugar, their chief articles of commerce,
which they despatch in their junks and other vessels.
Moreover, the people were not prepared for the change
which had taken place in the laws, and had scarcely cultivated
more than enough for home consumption; add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to this that the population is far from numerous, and,
the Siamese being an indolent race, most of the agriculture
falls into the hands of the Chinese, who flock to
Singapore, Australia, and California.</p>

<p>The country certainly merits the reputation which
it enjoys for beauty, but it is especially in its mountain
scenery that nature displays its grandeur.</p>

<p>During a ten years’ residence in Russia I witnessed
the frightful effects of despotism and slavery. At Siam,
results not less sad and deplorable obtruded themselves
on my notice; every inferior crouches before a higher in
rank; he receives his orders kneeling, or with some other
sign of abject submission and respect. The whole of society
is in a state of prostration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRESENTED TO THE KING OF SIAM.</div>

<p>I was making my preparations for departure on the
16th October, my purpose being to penetrate into the
north of the country and visit Cambodia and the savage
tribes belonging to it, when I received an invitation from
the King of Siam to be present at the great dinner which
this monarch gives every year, on his birthday, to the
European residents in Bangkok. I was presented by
Monseigneur Pallegoix, and his Majesty’s reception was
kind and courteous. His costume consisted of a pair of
large trousers, a short brown jacket of some thin material,
and slippers; on his head he wore a little copper helmet
like those worn by the naval officers, and at his side a
rich sabre.</p>

<p>Most of the Europeans in Bangkok were present at the
dinner, and enthusiastic toasts were drunk to the health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of his Majesty, who, instead of being seated, stood or
walked round the table, chewing betel and addressing
some pleasant observation to each of his guests in turn.
The repast was served in a vast hall, from whence we
could see a platoon of the royal guard, with flags and
drums, drawn up in the courtyard. When I went to take
leave of the King, he graciously presented me with a
little bag of green silk, containing some of the gold
and silver coin of the country,&mdash;a courtesy which was
most unexpected, and for which I expressed my gratitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KING SOMDEL PHRA.</div>

<p>This King, whose official title is Somdel Phra, Paramanda,
Maha-Mangkut&mdash;that is, His Majesty the King,
encircled with the Great Crown&mdash;was born on the 18th
October, 1804, and mounted the throne of Siam in the year
1851. The first part of his life was passed in complete
retirement in a monastery, in this following the example
of many of his predecessors: for all sects emanating from
Buddhism think it necessary that the rulers of nations
should prepare themselves for supreme power by a previous
life of repose and sanctity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACQUIREMENTS OF THE KING.</div>

<p>It was only after the accession of Somdel Phra that
the mastery he had gained over the most difficult sciences
became known. After having applied himself to the
history and geography of his country, he turned to the
study of astronomy, natural philosophy, politics, and
philology. He was familiar not only with all the dialects
of Siam and Indo-China, but also with ancient Sanscrit
and English, in which latter language he had written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
several treatises. The English journals at Hong-Kong
have been honoured by articles from his pen, and no one
who reads them can be surprised that the august contributor
should have been elected a member of the Asiatic
Society in London, a body which reckons on its list so
many savans of the first rank.</p>

<p>His Majesty had also acquired a fair knowledge of
Latin from the French missionaries, especially from Archbishop
Pallegoix, who has been his friend for thirty years.
He studied astronomy almost without a master, and had
gained such proficiency in that science as to be able to
calculate an eclipse and determine the latitude and longitude
of a place. He introduced a printing-press into his
dominions, in which both Siamese and Roman characters
are used. His language testifies to his education and
intelligence, though it more resembles the phraseology
of books than that of ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>His predecessor had several hundred wives, and I
believe the present King does not possess fewer than
some dozen; but he only bestowed the title of queen on
one, whose portrait hangs by the side of his own, and whose
death, soon after my visit, left him inconsolable.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE SECOND KING.</div>

<p>A singular institution, peculiar to Siam, Cambodia,
and Laos, exists in a second king, slightly inferior to the
other, and having a sort of reflected authority, the limits
of which are not easily defined. His official title is
Wangna, a word which literally signifies “the youngest
King.” He has his court, his mandarins, and his little
army, and they pay him royal honours; but in reality he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
is merely the first subject of his colleague. His sole prerogative
is exemption from the customary prostration
before the King, instead of which he salutes him by
raising both hands in the air. It is true, he is allowed to
draw largely from the royal treasury, but never without
an order from the King, which, however, is rarely
refused.</p>

<p>The present Wangna, Pin-Klau Chan You Hona, is
the legitimate brother of the First King and his intended
successor. He is a perfect gentleman, of a cultivated
mind, writing and speaking English, and leading in his
palace&mdash;which is arranged and furnished in our Western
fashion&mdash;the life of a rich, noble, and learned European.
He is fond of books and scientific researches, and familiar
with all the improvements of modern civilization; he
possesses in a higher degree than his brother the capacity
for government and statesmanship, and deplores more
than any one the sad condition in which his country languishes.</p>

<p>Before asking the reader to accompany me into the
interior of Siam, it will not be amiss, in the next chapter,
to give a short sketch of the kingdom itself and of its
past history.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Geography and History of the Kingdom of Siam.</span></p>


<div class="sidenote">HISTORY OF SIAM.</div>

<p>The name of Siam was first heard in Europe in the year
1502. Nine years after Alphonso d’Albuquerque had conquered
the peninsula of Malacca, some intercourse took
place between Portugal and Siam, which, however, was
interrupted by the long wars between this country and
the Burmese.</p>

<p>In 1632 an English vessel touched at the ancient capital
Ayuthia. Shortly afterwards the Portuguese at Goa sent
a party of Dominican and Franciscan missionaries to Siam,
and the communication between the two nations became
more frequent. The King engaged in his service three
hundred Portuguese soldiers, who were distributed over
the country, having lands allotted to them for cultivation,
and who contracted marriage with native women.
The missionaries built two churches, and established a
school.</p>

<p>After a while the Dutch power began to supplant that of
Portugal in the East, and, in the course of the seventeenth
century, the empire of Siam was brought into contact
with the new conquerors of the Indies. The Portuguese
colonies gradually became extinct; and the influence of
the Batavian settlers increased so much, that they esta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>blished
at Ayuthia a Dutch factory, which, under its
director Schonten, attained its greatest prosperity about
the year 1690. Various articles of merchandise were introduced
into Siam, from whence, in return, were exported
skins, sapan-wood, &amp;c.; and the country, from its position
and the richness of its natural productions, became at
that time an important station for the commerce of the
Dutch between China and Japan, and the valuable islands
of Ceylon and Java.</p>

<p>France herself, at the height of her maritime power
under Louis XIV., could not equal the power of the
Dutch Company, though, at one period, chances eminently
favourable presented themselves to her. A Greek adventurer
named Constantine Phaulcon, of whom we shall have
subsequently to speak, opened for himself a remarkable
career in Siam, where he was converted to Romanism
by the missionaries. He suggested to the King to send
envoys to Louis XIV., and their arrival in France produced
a sensation, the echo of which we have heard in
our own day in the embassy from the same country to
Napoleon III. His Most Christian Majesty replied by
accrediting ambassadors to the Siamese Court&mdash;De Chaumont
in 1685, and La Loubéze in 1687. Each was
accompanied by several Jesuit priests; and a force of 500
men, under the command of General de Fargues, was
stationed at Bangkok. The General, however, was not
able to maintain his position; Constantine met with a
tragic end, and the Jesuit fathers were kept as hostages.
These failures destroyed the French influence for more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
than a century and a half, and for a time strengthened the
power of Holland.</p>

<p>This brief glance at the intercourse between Europe
and Siam in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries will
suffice.</p>

<p class="caption">PAGODA AT AYUTHIA.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The celebrated German traveller Mandelslohe visited
the capital Ayuthia in 1537, and called it the Venice of
the East&mdash;a title which, as we have seen, is equally
applicable to the modern capital Bangkok. The Portuguese
explorer Mendez Pinto, who also paid a visit to
Siam in the sixteenth century, gives a favourable picture
of the country, and all that has since come to our knowledge
respecting it shows that he merited a greater faith
in his statements than was accorded to him by his contemporaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTENT OF SIAM.</div>

<p>The empire of Siam is of great extent. Its limits
have varied much at different epochs of its history; and
even now, with the exception of the western frontier, the
lines of demarcation cannot be exactly traced, most of
the border-lands being occupied by tribes more or less
independent, and there are perpetual wars between the
Malay and Burmese races on the one side, and the Cambodian
or Chinese on the other. As nearly as can be
calculated, the country extends, at present, from the 4th
to the 20th or 22nd degree of north latitude, and from the
96th to the 102nd degree of east longitude; and according
to this computation, its length would be about 1200 miles
and its breadth 400 miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROVINCES OF SIAM.</div>

<p>The Siamese dominions are divided into forty-one pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>vinces,
each presided over by a phaja or governor, and
these, again, are subdivided into numerous districts under
the authority of functionaries of inferior rank, of whose
administration little can be said in praise.</p>

<p>The northern provinces are five in number&mdash;Sangkalôk,
Phitsalôk or Phitsanulôk, Kumphang-Phet, Phixai, and
Tahëng. In the centre are nine provinces&mdash;Nantaburi
or Jalat-Khuan, Pak-Pret, Patummatoni or Samkuk,
Ayuthia or Krung-Kao, Ang-Thong, Monang-Phrom,
Monang-In, Xainat, and Nakhon-Savan.</p>

<p>There are seven in the west&mdash;Monang-Pin, Suphan or
Suphanaburi, Kan-Chanaburi or Pak-Phrëk, Rapri or
Raxaburi, Nakhon-Xaisi, Sakhonburi or Tha-Chin, Samut-Songkhram
or Mei-Khlong.</p>

<p>The eastern provinces number ten&mdash;Phetsjaboun, Bua-Xum,
Sara-Buri, Nopha-Buri, Nakhon-Najok, Patsjin,
Kabin, Sasong-Sao or Petriu, Battabâng, and Phanatsani-Khom.</p>

<p>In the south are&mdash;Pakhlat or Nakhon-Khuen-Khan,
Paknam or Sananthaprakan, Bangplasor or Xalaburi,
Rajong, Chantaboun or Chantabouri, Thung-Jai, Phiphri
or Phetxaburi, Xumphon, Xaya, and Xalang or Salang.</p>

<p>Siam has been distinguished by the historians of the
country under two great divisions&mdash;Monang-Nona, the
region of the north, at first the more populous portion, and
Monang-Tai, the southern region. The Chronicles of
the south are sometimes called ‘The Chronicles of the
Royal City’ (Ayuthia), and commence at the period when
this place became the capital. De Barrios relates that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in his time (the fifteenth century), nine states were in subjection
to the monarchs of Siam, two only of which were
peopled by the Siamese race&mdash;viz., the southern kingdom,
and that of the north, whose chief city was Chaumua.
The Siamese language, likewise, was spoken only in these
two countries.</p>

<p>Siam is called by the natives Thaï, or Monang-Thaï,
which means “free” or “the kingdom of the free.”
Archbishop Pallegoix, who is a great authority in these
matters, maintains that the modern name Siam is derived
from Sajam, or “the brown race.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONNECTION WITH NEIGHBOURING STATES.</div>

<p>While several districts in the north and east are tributary
to this country, it appears to have been itself
originally a great fief of China. Thus the King of Siam
receives from this neighbouring empire a special confirmation
of his authority, much resembling the patronage
accorded by the Sultan to the Barbary states. However,
if the external forms of this vassalage are observed, it is
rather from a profound respect for tradition and ancient
custom than from any virtual recognition of the power
of the Emperor of China to acknowledge or interfere with
the rights of sovereignty. One of the dependencies of this
country, Cambodia, is also claimed by Cochin-China, and
its ruler, unable to resist either of his more powerful
neighbours, is forced to pay tribute to both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">POPULATION.</div>

<p>The population of Siam cannot yet be determined
with any great exactness, but it is certain that it bears
no proportion to the extent of territory. Archbishop
Pallegoix estimates it at only 6,000,000&mdash;a computation,
however, very different from that of Sir John Bowring.
The difficulty of arriving at any correct result is augmented
by the Siamese custom of numbering only the men. Thus,
the native registers showed, a few years ago, for the male
sex, 2,000,000 Siamese, 1,000,000 Laotians, 1,000,000
Malays, 1,500,000 Chinese, 350,000 Cambodians, 50,000
Peguans, and a like number composed of various tribes
inhabiting the mountain ranges.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">PHYSICAL FEATURES.</div>

<p>In the north, a chain of mountains, covered with snow,
extends from the province of Yunan to China, and its
ramifications form two great divisions, between which is
situated the fertile valley of Siam. Another chain stretches
towards the west, as far as the Malay peninsula. The
great river Menam, already mentioned, traverses the level
country from north to south, taking its rise in the southern
slopes of the mountains of Yunan, and empties itself
into the Gulf of Siam. It is the Nile of this region, the
great fertility of which is owing to the annual overflowing
of its waters, an event eagerly looked for by the inhabitants,
and welcomed as a blessing from Heaven. The
Menam begins to rise in the month of June, and in
August the inundation reaches its height, and then the
waves of the ocean, opposing themselves to the current,
force the waters of the river back upon its banks. The
lands situated towards the middle of the great plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
receive most benefit from this operation of nature, the
higher districts being too much surrounded by mountains,
while the lower are impregnated with so much salt water
as to render the cultivation of rice difficult. If the
regular inundations are, as a general rule, productive of
immense benefit, they now and then, as in Egypt, lay
waste the country: thus, for example, that of 1851
destroyed all the sugar-plantations; and the water, to a
depth of three or four feet, resting on the earth for some
time, a large number of cattle perished, the rice-crops
suffered seriously, and many valuable fruit-trees were
carried away. Some years afterwards, however, in
accordance with nature’s beneficent law of compensation,
the produce was only the more abundant.</p>

<p>The ancient annals of Siam relate that, about the
seventh century, Chinese junks used to ascend the stream
as far as Sang-Khalak, a distance of 120 leagues from
the sea; at present it is only navigable for 30 leagues
at most. This alteration has arisen from a gradually-increasing
collection of sand and alluvial deposit&mdash;a process
which goes on in some of our western rivers, as, for
instance, the Rhine and the Meuse.</p>

<p>The low grounds, as is usually the case in hot climates,
are less healthy than the mountainous districts, and the
forests especially are the seat of malignant fevers. Several
other rivers, and numberless canals, fringed with bamboos
and fruit-trees, round which fly a multitude of birds,
give a pleasing aspect to the country, which is bounded
on the horizon by richly-wooded hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The rivers are rich in fish, which, in addition to rice,
forms the principal food of the people.</p>

<p class="caption">PERFORATED ROCK IN THE ISLE OF EBOULON, GULF OF SIAM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The shores of the sea are very picturesque, and the coast
is studded with islands covered with the most luxuriant
vegetation. “The Gulf of Siam,” says Mgr. Pallegoix,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
“is not subject to storms, nor to the destructive typhoons
experienced on the Chinese seaboard; thus shipwrecks are
of rare occurrence.”</p>

<p>Sir John Bowring recommends to his countrymen a
project which he believes feasible, and which would
scarcely be secondary in importance to the intersection of
the Isthmus of Darien or that of Suez. It is the union
of the Bay of Bengal with the Gulf of Siam. He hopes
that the establishment of amicable relations between Great
Britain and the Siamese Empire will lead to the ventilation
and eventual solution of a question so interesting both
in a geographical and commercial point of view. It would
be, in reality, as he says, a noble enterprise, which would
considerably shorten the voyage between India and Eastern
Asia, by making no longer necessary the tedious détour
through the Straits of Malacca, a passage which occupies
not days, but weeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MINERALS.</div>

<p>The soil of this country, composed in great part of
alluvial earth, in Siam watered by its great river, and
in Cambodia by the Nekong and many other streams,
refreshed by the periodical rains, and glowing beneath a
tropical sky, possesses almost unlimited capabilities. The
mountains in the north contain precious metals, but the
working of them is as yet very imperfectly attempted.
The tin of Siam has been long in repute; copper, lead, and
iron have also been discovered. Diamonds and other
precious stones exist, although the exact localities where
they are met with are not known, for the natives are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
very mysterious on the subject; but it is supposed that
diamonds are found on the eastern boundary of the Gulf.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHIVES.</div>

<p>The history of the empire, arranged in the form of
chronicles, is preserved in the archives, and not permitted
to be inspected by strangers. The late king made investigations
into these documents, which, previously to
the foundation of Ayuthia, towards the middle of the
fourteenth century, only presented a mass of confused
materials, in which truth and fable are curiously intermingled,
as in the annals of all nations, and pre-eminently
those of the Orientals, who love to substitute
highly-coloured narratives, in the style of the Arabian
Nights, for plain history.</p>

<p>The Siamese trace their genealogy up to the first
disciples of Buddha (Gandama), and commence their
records five centuries before the Christian era. A succession
of dynasties, varying their seat of government,
figure in the earlier volumes; and the miracles of Buddha,
and the intervention of supernatural beings, are frequently
introduced. Later on there are accounts of matrimonial
alliances between Siamese princes and the Imperial families
of China, and of embassies to, and wars with, neighbouring
countries, the whole interwoven with relations of
prodigies and marvellous legends respecting Sudra and
other divinities. After the establishment of Ayuthia as
the capital, history assumes its rightful place, and the
succession of the sovereigns and the course of events are
registered with tolerable correctness. The city of Ayuthia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
was founded by Phaja-Utong, who took the title of Phra-Rama-Thibaldi.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HISTORICAL SKETCH.</div>

<p>Instead of dwelling on the ancient history of Siam,
we prefer to give an extract from the appendix to the
celebrated work of Sir John Bowring, ‘The Kingdom
and People of Siam:’ the passage originally appeared
in ‘The Chinese Repository,’ and is from the pen of the
late <span class="lock">king:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Our ancient capital Ayuthia, before the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1350,
was but the ruin of an ancient place belonging to Kambuja
(now known as Cambodia), formerly called Lawék,
whose inhabitants then possessed Southern Siam, or
Western Kambuja. Ayuthia is situated in lat. 14° 19′ N.,
and long. 100° 37′ E. from Greenwich. There were other
cities, not far remote, also possessed by the Kambujans;
but their precise locality or much of their history cannot
now be satisfactorily ascertained. Some time near the
year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1300, the former inhabitants were much diminished
by frequent wars with the northern Siamese and
the Peguans, or <i>Mous</i>, so that these cities were vacated,
or left in a ruinous state, and nothing remained but their
names.</p>

<p>“Former inhabitants declared that the people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Chiang-rái, a province of what is now called Chiang-mái
(North Laos), and Kampengpet, being frequently subjected
to great annoyance from their enemies, deserted their
native country, and formed a new establishment at Ch’á-liang,
in the western part of Siam proper, and built a
city, which they called Thepha-mahá-na-khon, whence has
been preserved in the national records the name of our
capital down to the present day, Krung-Thepha-mahá-na-khon.
Their city was about lat. 16° N., and long. 99° E.,
and there five kings of the first dynasty reigned, until
the sixth, named U-T’ong Rámá-thi-bodi, ascended the
throne in 1344. This king, it is said, was son-in-law of
his predecessor, who was named Sirichai Chiang Seu, who
was without male issue, and therefore the throne descended
to the son-in-law by right of the royal daughter.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PAGODA OF AYUTHIA, FROM THE RIVER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“U-T’ong Rámá-thi-bodi was a mightier prince than
any of his predecessors, and subsequently conquered and
subjected to his sway all Southern Siam, and some provinces
in the Malayan peninsula. He made Ch’á-liang
the seat of his government for six years, and then, in
consequence of the prevalence of disease of a pestilential
character, he caused various researches to be made
for some more healthy location, and finally fixed upon the
site of Ayuthia, and there founded his new capital in
April, 1350. This date is an ascertained fact. From
this period our Siamese annals are more exact and the
accounts generally reliable, being accompanied by dates
of days, months, and years, from 1350 to 1767.</p>

<p class="caption">VIEW TAKEN FROM THE CANAL OF AYUTHIA.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>“Ayuthia, when founded, was gradually improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and became more and more populous by natural increase,
and the settlement there of families of Laos, Kambujans,
Peguans, people from Yunnán in China, who had been
brought there as captives, and by Chinese and Mussulmans
from India, who came for the purposes of trade.
Here reigned fifteen kings of one dynasty, successors of
and belonging to the family of U-T’ong Rámá-thi-bodi,
who, after his death, was honourably designated as Phra
Chetha Bida&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> ‘Royal Elder Brother Father.’ This
line was interrupted by one interloping usurper between
the thirteenth and fourteenth. The last king was Ma-híntrá-thi-rát.
During his reign the renowned King of
Pegu, named Chamna-dischop, gathered an immense
army, consisting of Peguans, Burmese, and inhabitants of
Northern Siam, and made an attack upon Ayuthia. The
ruler of Northern Siam was Mahá-thamma rájá, related
to the fourteenth king as son-in-law, and to the last as
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“After a siege of three months the Peguans took
Ayuthia, but did not destroy it or its inhabitants, the
Peguan monarch contenting himself with capturing the
king and royal family, to take with him as trophies to
Pegu, and delivered the country over to be governed
by Mahá-thamma rájá, as a dependency. The King of
Pegu also took back with him the oldest son of Mahá-thamma
rájá as a hostage: his name was Phra Náret.
This conquest of Ayuthia by the King of Pegu took place
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1556.</p>

<p>“This state of dependence and tribute continued but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a few years. The King of Pegu died, and in the confusion
incident to the elevation of his son as his successor,
Prince Náret escaped with his family, and, attended by
many Peguans of influence, commenced his return to his
native land. The new king, on hearing of his escape,
despatched an army to seize and bring him back. They
followed him till he had crossed the Si-thong (Burman,
Sit-thaung) River, where he turned against the Peguan
army, shot the commander, who fell from his elephant
dead, and then proceeded in safety to Ayuthia.</p>

<p>“War with Pegu followed, and Siam again became
independent. On the demise of Mahá-thamma rájá, Prince
Náret succeeded to the throne, and became one of the
mightiest and most renowned rulers Siam ever had. In
his wars with Pegu he was accompanied by his younger
brother, Eká-tassa-rot, who succeeded Náret on the throne,
but, on account of mental derangement, was soon removed,
and Phra Siri Sin Wi-mon-tham was called by the nobles
from the priesthood to the throne. He had been very
popular as a learned and religious teacher, and commanded
the respect of all the public counsellors; but he
was not of the royal family. His coronation took place
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1602. There had preceded him a race of nineteen
kings, excepting one usurper. The new king submitted
all authority in government to a descendant of the former
line of kings, and to him also he intrusted his sons for
education, reposing confidence in him as capable of
maintaining the royal authority over all the tributary
provinces. This officer thus became possessed of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
highest dignity and power. His master had been raised
to the throne at an advanced age. During the twenty-six
years he was on the throne he had three sons, born under
the royal canopy&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the great white umbrella, one of
the insignia of royalty.</p>

<p>“After the demise of the king, at an extreme old age,
the personage whom he had appointed as regent, in full
council of the nobles, raised his eldest son, then sixteen
years old, to the throne. A short time after the regent
caused the second son to be slain, under the pretext of
a rebellion against his elder brother. Those who were
envious of the regent, excited the king to revenge his
brother’s death as causeless, and plan the regent’s assassination;
but he, being seasonably apprised of it, called a
council of the nobles and dethroned him after one year’s
reign, and then raised his youngest brother, the third
son, to the throne.</p>

<p>“He was only eleven years old. His extreme youth
and fondness for play, rather than politics or government,
soon created discontent. Men of office saw that it
was exposing their country to contempt, and sought for
some one who might fill the place with dignity. The
regent was long accustomed to all the duties of the
government, and had enjoyed the confidence of their late
venerable king; so, with one voice, the child was dethroned
and the regent exalted under the title of Phra Chau Pra
Sath-thong. This event occurred <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1630.</p>

<p class="caption">RUINS OF A PAGODA AT AYUTHIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“The king was said to have been connected with the
former dynasty, both paternally and maternally; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
connection must have been quite remote and obscure.
Under the reign of the priest-king he bore the title
Raja Suriwong, as indicating a remote connection with
the royal family. From him descended a line of ten
kings, who reigned at Ayuthia and Lopha-buri&mdash;Louvo
of French writers. This line was once interrupted by an
usurper between the fourth and fifth reigns. This usurper
was the foster-father of an unacknowledged though real
son of the fourth king Chau Nárái. During his reign
many European merchants established themselves and
their trade in the country, among whom was Constantine
Phaulkon (Faulkon). He became a great favourite
through his skill in business, his suggestions and superintendence
of public works after European models, and
by his presents of many articles regarded by the people
of those days as great curiosities, such as telescopes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“King Nárái, the most distinguished of all Siamese
rulers, before or since, being highly pleased with the
services of Constantine, conferred on him the title of
Chau Phyá Wicha-yentrá-thé-bodi, under which title there
devolved on him the management of the government in
all the northern provinces of the country. He suggested
to the king the plan of erecting a fort on European principles
as a protection to the capital. This was so acceptable
a proposal, that at the king’s direction he was
authorised to select the location and construct the fort.</p>

<p>“He selected a territory which was then employed
as garden-ground, but is now the territory of Bangkok.
On the west bank, near the mouth of a canal, now called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Báng-luang, he constructed a fort, which bears the name
of Wichayeiw Fort to this day. It is close to the residence
of his Royal Highness Chaufá-noi Kromma Khun
Isaret rangsan. This fort and circumjacent territory was
called Thana-buri. A wall was erected, enclosing a space
of about 100 yards square. Another fort was built on the
east side of the river, where the walled city of Bangkok
now stands. The ancient name Bangkok was in use when
the whole region was a garden.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The above-mentioned
fort was erected about the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1675.</p>

<p class="caption">THE GREAT TOWER OF THE PAGODA WAT-CHING AT BANGKOK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“This extraordinary European also induced his grateful
sovereign King Nárái to repair the old city of Lopha-buri
(Louvo), and construct there an extensive royal
palace on the principles of European architecture. On
the north of this palace Constantine erected an extensive
and beautiful collection of buildings for his own residence.
Here also he built a Romish church, on which
are still to be seen some inscriptions in European letters,
supposed to be Dutch or German; they assuredly are
neither French nor English (perhaps they are Greek, as
he was of Greek extraction, and born at Cephalonia).
The ruins of all these edifices and their walls are still
to be seen, and are said to be a great curiosity. It is
moreover stated that he planned the construction of
canals, with reservoirs at intervals for bringing water
from the mountains on the north-east to the city Lopha-buri,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and conveying it through earthen and copper pipes
and syphons, so as to supply the city in the dry season on
the same principle as that adopted in Europe. He commenced
also a canal, with embankments, to the holy
place called Phra-Bat, about twenty-five miles south-west
from the city. He made an artificial pond on the summit
of Phra-Bat mountain, and thence, by means of copper
tubes and stop-cocks, conveyed abundance of water to
the kitchen and bath-rooms of the royal residence at the
foot of the mountain. His works were not completed
when misfortune overtook him.</p>

<p>“Many Siamese officers and royal ministers were jealous
of his influence, and murmured their suspicions of his
being a secret rebel. At length he was accused of designing
to put the king to death by inviting him to visit the
church he had built, between the walls of which, it is said,
he had inserted a quantity of gunpowder, which was to be
ignited by a match at a given signal, and thus involve
the death of the king. On this serious charge he was
assassinated by private order of the king. (This is the
traditional story: the written annals state that he was
slain in his sedan while faithful to his king, by order of
a rebel prince, who perceived he could not succeed in his
nefarious plans against the throne while Constantine
lived.) The works which he left half done are now generally
in ruins, viz. the canal to Phra-Bat and the aqueduct
at the mountains.</p>

<p>“After the demise of Nárái, his unacknowledged son,
born of a princess of Yunnan or Chiang-Mai, and intrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
for training to the care of Phya Petcha raja, slew Nárái’s
son and heir, and constituted his foster-father king, himself
acting as prime minister till the death of his foster-father,
fifteen years after; he then assumed the royal state himself.
He is ordinarily spoken of as Nai Dua. Two of his sons
and two of his grandsons subsequently reigned at Ayuthia.
The youngest of these grandsons reigned only a
short time, and then surrendered the royal authority to
his brother and entered the priesthood. While this
brother reigned, in the year 1759, the Burman king,
Meng-luang Alaung Barah-gyi, came with an immense
army, marching in three divisions on as many distinct
routes, and combined at last in the siege of Ayuthia.</p>

<p>“The Siamese king, Chaufa Ekadwat Anurak Moutri,
made no resolute effort of resistance. His great officers
disagreed in their measures. The inhabitants of all the
smaller towns were indeed called behind the walls of
the city, and ordered to defend it to their utmost ability;
but jealousy and dissension rendered all their bravery
useless. Sallies and skirmishes were frequent, in which
the Burmese were generally the victorious party. The
siege was continued for two years. The Burmese commander-in-chief,
Mahá Nōratha, died, but his principal
officers elected another in his place. At the end of the
two years the Burmese, favoured by the dry season, when
the waters were shallow, crossed in safety, battered the
walls, broke down the gates, and entered without resistance.
The provisions of the Siamese were exhausted,
confusion reigned, and the Burmese fired the city and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
public buildings. The king, badly wounded, escaped with
his flying subjects, but soon died alone of his wounds and
his sorrows. He was subsequently discovered and buried.</p>

<p>“His brother, who was in the priesthood and now the
most important personage in the country, was captured
by the Burmans, to be conveyed in triumph to Burmah.
They perceived that the country was too remote from
their own to be governed by them; they therefore freely
plundered the inhabitants, beating, wounding, and even
killing many families, to induce them to disclose treasures
which they supposed were hidden by them. By these
measures the Burmese officers enriched themselves with
most of the wealth of the country. After two or three
months spent in plunder they appointed a person of Mon
or Peguan origin as ruler over Siam, and withdrew with
numerous captives, leaving this Peguan officer to gather
fugitives and property to convey to Burmah at some
subsequent opportunity. This officer was named Phrá
Nái Kông, and made his head-quarters about three miles
north of the city, at a place called Phō Sam-ton, <i>i. e.</i> ‘the
three Sacred Fig-trees.’ One account relates that the
last king mentioned above, when he fled from the city
wounded, was apprehended by a party of travellers and
brought into the presence of Phyá Nái Kông in a state
of great exhaustion and illness; that he was kindly
received and respectfully treated, as though he was still
the sovereign; and that Phyá Nái Kông promised to
confirm him again as ruler of Siam, but his strength
failed and he died a few days after his apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“The conquest by Burmah, the destruction of Ayuthia,
and appointment of Phyá Nái Kông, took place in March,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1767. This date is unquestionable. The period
between the foundation of Ayuthia and its overthrow by
the Burmans embraces 417 years, during which there were
thirty-three kings of three distinct dynasties, of which the
first dynasty had nineteen kings with one usurper, the
second had three kings, and the third had nine kings and
one usurper.</p>

<p>“When Ayuthia was conquered by the Burmese, in
March, 1767, there remained in the country many bands
of robbers associated under brave men as their leaders.
These parties had continued their depredations since the
first appearance of the Burman army, and during about
two years had lived by plundering the quiet inhabitants,
having no government to fear. On the return of the
Burman troops to their own country, these parties of
robbers had various skirmishes with each other during the
year 1767.</p>

<p class="caption">PRIEST’S HOUSE NEAR AYUTHIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“The first king established at Bangkok was an extraordinary
man, of Chinese origin, named Pin Tat. He
was called by the Chinese Tia Sin Tat, or Tuat. He was
born at a village called Bánták, in Northern Siam, in
lat. 16° N. The date of his birth was in March, 1734. At
the capture of Ayuthia he was thirty-three years old.
Previous to that time he had obtained the office of
second governor of his own township, Ták, and he next
obtained the office of governor of his own town, under
the dignified title of Phyá Ták, which name he bears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the present day. During the reign of the last King of
Ayuthia, he was promoted to the office and dignity
of governor of the city of Kam-Cheng-philet, which
from times of antiquity was called the capital of the
western province of Northern Siam. He obtained this
office by bribing the high minister of the king, Chaufá
Ekadwat Anurak Moutri; and being a brave warrior, he
was called to Ayuthia on the arrival of the Burman
troops, as a member of the council. But when sent to
resist the Burman troops, who were harassing the eastern
side of the city, perceiving that the Ayuthian government
was unable to resist the enemy, he, with his
followers, fled to Chautaburi (Chautabun), a town on the
eastern shore of the Gulf of Siam, in lat. 12&frac12;° N. and
long. 101° 21′ E. There he united with many brave
men, who were robbers and pirates, and subsisted by
robbing the villages and merchant-vessels. In this way
he became the great military leader of the district, and
had a force of more than ten thousand men. He soon
formed a treaty of peace with the headman of Báng-plásoi,
a district on the north, and with Kambuja and
Annam (or Cochin China) on the south-east.”</p>

<p>Such is the short historical sketch, given by the late
King of Siam, up to this date, and which we must complete
from other sources.</p>

<p>As much by stratagem as by force of arms, he gained
possession of the northern districts; but, not deeming
himself secure enough from hostile attacks in that part of
the country, he decided on falling back towards the south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and established himself at Bangkok, having previously
surprised and put to death Phrá-Nai-Kông, the Burman
governor of that place, and seized on a quantity of money,
provisions, and ammunition. Its proximity to the sea
afforded many advantages, one being that escape would
be tolerably easy should fortune prove adverse to him.
He there built a palace on the western bank of the river,
near the fort, which is now standing.</p>

<p>After various encounters with the Burmans, he reduced
them into subjection, mainly through the assistance of
his flotilla; and on one occasion he overpowered their
whole camp, recovering great part of the booty they had
amassed, and finally freeing the country from those bitter
foes, who had brought into it so much desolation and
terror. The people, in gratitude to their deliverer, gladly
aided him in his assumption of royal authority. He issued
his mandates from Bangkok, appointed viceroys, and distributed
colonists far and wide for the repeopling of the
country. Thus, by the end of 1768, he found himself
sovereign of all the southern part of Siam and the
eastern provinces on the shores of the Gulf.</p>

<p class="caption">DETAILS OF THE PAGODA WAT-CHANG AT BANGKOK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Profiting by a sanguinary war between China and
Burmah, he reconquered the northern district of Horahh.
He had still to contend with a revolt organised by a prince
of the old dynasty, who, pending the struggle with the
Burmans, had taken refuge in Ceylon. This, however, was
soon quelled; and two more provinces were recovered,
which had taken advantage of the foreign invasion to
assert their independence. At the end of three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Phya-Jak was master of the whole of the north, and had
everywhere re-established peace and order. His dominion
being now set on a firm foundation, it was a comparatively
easy matter successfully to resist a new attack of
the Burmans in 1771; and the year following he sent
an expedition into the Malay peninsula to take possession
of Lagor, whose governor, formerly a vassal of the
king, had assumed the sovereignty, and proclaimed Phya-Jak
a usurper. The governor, being worsted in several
engagements, took refuge with the chief of Patawi, a
town in the peninsula, by whom he was surrendered to
the followers of Phya-Jak. The king himself, meanwhile,
had entered Lagor, made captives of all the governor’s
family, and carried off his treasures. Among his relatives
was a daughter possessed of great beauty: the King
gave her a place in his harem; and, through her intercession,
her father and all the family were spared.
Three or four years afterwards she procured his reinstatement
as prince of that district, which at the present
day is governed by his descendants.</p>

<p>Phya-Jak’s reign did not end happily: in the latter
part of his life he fell into a state of morbid melancholy,
treated his subjects with cruelty, and lost his popularity.
One of his generals, Chakri, commanding in Cambodia,
took advantage of these circumstances to concert a plot
against the King, who was taken prisoner at Bangkok,
and assassinated in the year 1782. Chakri ascended the
throne, and, dying soon afterwards, was succeeded by his
son. The old quarrels with the Burmans were renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
about some disputed districts on the northern frontier;
and the Siamese monarch came victoriously out of two
encounters, but, in a third, was overcome, and lost the
western part of the country lying towards Burmah.</p>

<p>This king died in 1809, and his son and successor,
fearing, or feigning to dread, conspiracies against him, put
to death one hundred and seventeen Siamese nobles,
among whom were several generals who had fought by
his father’s side against the Burmans. This atrocious
massacre, and the murder of a cousin much beloved by
the people, alienated their affections from him. In other
respects he ruled with wisdom and moderation: keeping
in check the turbulent Malays, he also successfully
repulsed the incursions of the Burmans, bringing his
prisoners to Bangkok, where he gave them lands to cultivate,
and thus extended his capital.</p>

<p>The English Government, wishing to form a commercial
treaty with this prince, sent Mr. Crawfurd on a
mission to Siam; but although that gentleman obtained
much interesting information respecting the country, he
failed in attaining his purpose. Allowed to remain with
his suite for some time at Bangkok, they were treated
rather as prisoners than guests. Their propositions were
rejected; and the only concession obtained from his
Majesty was a promise not to increase the export and
import duties, the entire abolition of which had been the
object of the negotiation. The King died in 1824, and
was succeeded by his illegitimate son, Crom-Chiat.</p>

<p class="caption">RUINS AT AYUTHIA.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN.</div>

<p>This prince, although he feared the English, saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
advantages of an extended commerce, and, in 1826, concluded
a treaty with Great Britain, then represented by
Captain Burney; but it did not effect all that had been
desired. Direct mercantile intercourse between the two
countries was certainly guaranteed, and assistance in all
cases of shipwreck on the coast; but English subjects,
during their stay, were to be subject to the laws of the
empire; and in each province the commerce could be
extended or limited at the will of the governor. As
these functionaries constantly infringed the terms of the
treaty, and imposed heavy charges on the native articles
exported, as well as on British goods introduced, disappointment
naturally resulted; and the Siamese, fearing
a resort to arms on the part of England, made preparations
for defence, and fortified the mouth of the Menam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISSIONS IN SIAM.</div>

<p>Meanwhile France was attempting to resume her old
intercourse with Siam; but at first great distrust was
manifested of the Catholic missionaries. In 1780 they
had been ordered, on pain of death, to quit the kingdom;
they retired for a time, but again gradually insinuated
themselves, and met with considerable success. We owe
to Mgr. Pallegoix, in addition to an interesting relation
of the progress of the mission, very important information
concerning this empire in the far East&mdash;its literature,
and the character and the manners of the inhabitants.
He established there seven churches and four chapels;
a seminary in which are thirty native pupils, several
other schools, and four monasteries; and has baptized
eight thousand Siamese. The King, annoyed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
advance of the new religion, issued, in 1848, an edict
against the missionaries, commanding the destruction of
all their places of worship; but it was very partially
carried into execution.</p>

<p>The Protestant mission has had a more restricted
sphere of action. The celebrated Dr. Gutzlaff made a
long stay at Bangkok in 1828, and finished there his
translation of the New Testament into Siamese. This
work was published at Singapore, and has since been
widely circulated. In 1830 he revisited Siam, and translated
the greater part of the Scriptures into the languages
of Cambodia and Laos. At his request the
American Baptists founded the first Protestant mission at
Siam; the Presbyterians established a second in 1840;
and a third was founded, in 1850, by the Society of the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.
Their labours, however, have not yet been crowned with
any great success; nevertheless, by uniting to their
ministerial office the practice of medicine, they have
done much good, and been favourably received by the
people.</p>

<p>The French priests have recently made efforts to gain
an influence over the government of Siam. At the death
of the King Orom-Chiat, his son Chao-Fa, then twenty
years of age, should have been his rightful successor, but
an elder illegitimate son seized on the throne, promising
his brother to resign it in a few years. This promise not
having been fulfilled, the prince, as we have before mentioned,
went into complete retirement, and gave himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
up to scientific pursuits. He then came into contact with
the Catholic missionaries, and, at their persuasion, made
himself acquainted with their religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHBISHOP PALLEGOIX.</div>

<p>In 1851 the King fell ill, and, in spite of the promise
to his brother, wished to appoint one of his own sons as
his successor; but he was answered that the country
had already a sovereign; and, on his decease, Prince
Chao-Fa mounted the throne, under the name of Somdet
Phra. Mgr. Pallegoix addressed to him a letter of congratulation,
and presented him with a portrait of Louis
Napoleon, then President of the French Republic. The
King, in return, made him a gift of money, and revoked
the decree of banishment against the five Catholic priests;
and at an audience granted to the bishop before his
departure for Europe, in 1852, he charged him with
messages to Prince Louis Napoleon and the Pope,&mdash;intrusting
to him an autograph letter for the latter,
written in English, and expressing a great regard for
his Holiness, as well as his resolution to grant full toleration
in his kingdom to the Catholic religion.</p>

<p>He also declared to the archbishop<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> his intention of
assuring to his subjects entire religious liberty, with
which view he made inquiries from time to time respecting
the work of the Catholic missionaries, so as to protect
the converted natives against the heathen governors.
From that time the friendship with France has never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
been interrupted, but has become more and more intimate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREATY WITH FRANCE.</div>

<p>Negotiations were commenced at Bangkok in 1856, in
the name of the French Government, which terminated
in a highly satisfactory manner, a treaty of friendship
and commerce being signed on the 15th August between
the two countries, which was ratified in the following
year. The reception accorded to M. de Montigny, the
French envoy, on this occasion by the two kings, was as
brilliant as it was cordial; nor was he entertained less
kindly by any of the authorities with whom he came
in contact, which proved that Siam has preserved a
pleasing remembrance of the embassies exchanged with
Louis XIV.</p>

<p>All this augured favourably for the future friendly
relations between the two Crowns; and these were confirmed
in the year 1861, when his Siamese Majesty sent
an embassy to Paris, where it arrived in June, and was
received with great magnificence.</p>

<p class="caption">SIAMESE LADIES AT DINNER.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">COMMERCE.</div>

<p>A French publication<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> gave the following account of
the commerce with Siam:&mdash;“According to the information
obtained from M. de Montigny, the commercial and
maritime relations between the kingdom of Siam and
Europe are capable of great development. Already more
than sixty European ships, have since 1854 entered yearly
the port of Bangkok, to which must be added a considerable
number of junks and <i>prahus</i>, which navigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the China Sea and the Malayan Archipelago. The
markets of Siam and Laos abound in natural products,
such as tobacco, cotton, sugar, spice, and dyes. The
forests abound with magnificent trees, particularly teak.
By the terms of the treaty with France, the duties,
whether import or export, are but three per cent. on the
value of the merchandise. There is therefore room for
hope that commerce, favoured by the moderation of this
tariff, will rapidly increase, and that the French navy
will profit by it.”</p>

<p>In ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Annales du Commerce Extérieur</span>’ we find the
following account:&mdash;“The greater part of the commerce
of Siam, Laos, and Cambodia is in the hands of the
Chinese, who are much more active and intelligent than
the natives. Their mercantile transactions are generally
characterised by dishonesty, and we cannot too strongly
warn our traders against the frauds of every kind common
in this country, such as mixing diverse qualities, adulteration,
and saturating various articles with moisture to
increase the weight. Raw silk, cotton, and hemp, tobacco,
and other merchandise sold by weight, should be carefully
examined when delivered, and always compared with the
samples, which it is prudent to demand beforehand. The
treaty concluded between the Siamese Government and
France abolishes all monopolies, and obliges the authorities
to watch over the strict and faithful execution of
all bargains; therefore, in case of fraud, traders should
show a bold face and demand indemnity. They should
be careful themselves to set an example of strict probity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
this being the surest way to improve the morality of the
Siamese merchants, who, in dealing with people of proved
honesty, will have less temptation to employ fraud.</p>

<p>“The best commerce will be, doubtless, that of barter;
but it will be difficult to carry this to any great extent,
as these people have few wants. Their ordinary dress,
for example, consists simply of drawers in the hot
season, to which in winter they add one or more scarves,
to cover the upper part of the body. The dignitaries
and wealthy individuals on state occasions wear a rich
suit, consisting of drawers, vest, belt, and a large tunic.
They go barefoot, rarely having even sandals. They are
not of a migratory nature, but have their fixed habitations,
and are fond of elegance and luxury. Very imitative
in their ways, they feel a pride in putting on a
European dress; and some of those made after the
fashion of Louis XIV.’s reign are still preserved, especially
among the descendants of the Portuguese, who
are numerous. The uniforms of the soldiers are copied
from those of Europe; and the whole nation has a great
taste for our Parisian furniture, cotton, silk, and woollen
fabrics, porcelain, china, glass, bronzes, cutlery, ironmongery,
and toys. Other articles in much esteem with
them, and exported by us, are fire-arms, side-arms,
saddlery, quilts, carpets, clocks, and windows. Our
champagne, brandy, gin, and kirsch, would find in Siam
a certain and ready sale in exchange for the produce of
the country.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREATY WITH AMERICA.</div>

<p>The efforts of the Americans to obtain from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Siamese Government favourable terms of commerce were
for a time fruitless, but in 1833 a treaty was concluded
with the United States, which proved of but little material
benefit. A second embassy from the Western Republic
failed completely. Balestier, the envoy, could not even
obtain an audience from the king, and consequently was
unable to deliver his letters of credit. The Americans
had been unfortunate in their choice of Balestier as their
representative, he having formerly been in a mercantile
house at Singapore, and in no favour either with the
king or his ministers. A treaty was, however, eventually
concluded between the two nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREATY WITH ENGLAND.</div>

<p>Sir James Brooke, the English ambassador at Bangkok,
found his advances coldly received. Possibly the Court
felt aggrieved by the attitude assumed by that gentleman;
but, whatever may have been the reason, matters
nearly approached to an open rupture. In September,
1850, he abandoned the negotiation, and Great Britain
and Siam remained estranged, until the English Government,
desirous to establish friendly relations with the
Eastern monarch, despatched Sir John Bowring to Bangkok,
with instructions to arrange a commercial treaty,
which he effected in 1855. His travels have been published
in two volumes, and contain, perhaps, the most
accurate and full information we possess of Siam. It was
particularly from his acquaintance with the language and
manners of the nation that Sir John Bowring acquitted
himself so well of his task. He was received at Court
with great favour, and had several interviews with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
king, whose thirst for knowledge pleased him, and whose
good will he managed to secure. In all his negotiations
with the Siamese ministers he displayed skill and adroitness.
Knowing by experience what would be the most
profitable conditions, he succeeded in effecting the ratification
of an advantageous agreement on the 18th April,
1855, by which the Crown of Siam consented to the appointment
of a British consul at the capital, and granted
entire liberty of commerce to English merchants in all
the maritime districts of the empire. All duties were
lowered; those upon opium almost entirely abolished,
provision being made that this article should only be
sold to parties specially licensed by the Government.
On the other hand, the English traders might purchase
all the productions of the country directly from the producer.
It is only in times of scarcity that the king
reserves to himself the right of forbidding the exportation
of rice, salt, and fish. English subjects are permitted
to settle at Bangkok, to hold landed property there,
build or purchase houses, and to lease land to others;
but this last privilege is only accorded after a ten years’
possession.</p>

<p>Full toleration in religious matters was guaranteed; and
if the presence of a British ship of war was at any time
thought requisite for protection of their interests, it was
permitted to lie in the Gulf, but not to pass beyond
Paknam without express leave from the Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INCREASED FAVOUR TO EUROPEANS.</div>

<p>Holland has also renewed her ancient dealings with
the country, and ratified a treaty during the present year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
(1862). Even before the arrival of the Siamese ambassadors
in Europe, a French publication<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> said very justly,
“The Government of Siam is showing itself more and
more favourable towards Europeans, who find at Bangkok
not only protection, but sympathy and toleration for
their religion. Bangkok has become one of the most considerable
markets of Asia; and the kingdom of Siam is
reaping the reward of the liberal politics which it has
introduced into the extreme East, and which is warmly
seconded by France, England, and the United States.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Voyage up the Menam to Ayuthia the ancient Capital&mdash;The
Ruins&mdash;Excursion to Mount Phrabat&mdash;its Temple&mdash;its
Sacred and Geological Footsteps&mdash;Saraburi and Patavi.</span></p></div>


<p>After my visits of ceremony to the two kings, I hastened
to finish the preparations for my voyage. I bought a
light boat capable of holding all my chests, reserving
a narrow space for myself, and another for the bipeds
and quadrupeds forming my adopted family&mdash;viz., two
rowers, one of whom also officiated as cook, a parroquet,
an ape, and a dog. One of the boatmen was a Cambodian,
and the other an Annamite, both Christians, and
knowing a few words of Latin<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and English, so that,
as I had already picked up a little Siamese, I could
make myself pretty well understood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VOYAGE UP THE MENAM.</div>

<p>On the 19th October I quitted Bangkok, and commenced
my voyage up the Menam. The current runs
very strongly at this season, and it took us five days to
go about seventy miles. At night we suffered terribly
from the mosquitoes, and even during the day had to keep
up an incessant fanning to drive off these pestilent little
vampires. They were so numerous that you could catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
them by handfuls, and their humming resembled that of
a hive of bees. These insects are the curse of all tropical
countries, but here they peculiarly abound in the marshes
and lands covered with slime and mud left by the retiring
waters, where the heat of the sun and the moisture combined,
favour their rapid increase. My legs suffered
especially from their attacks.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">THE INUNDATION OF THE MENAM.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>As the country was entirely inundated, we could not
land anywhere, and even after killing a bird I frequently
could not get at it. All this was very tantalising, for the
banks of the stream are very gay and attractive, nature
wearing here her richest dress.</p>

<p>At this time of the year the rains have entirely
ceased, and do not return for several months. For some
days the north-eastern monsoon had been blowing, the
weather was constantly fine, and the heat tempered by
the wind. The waters, also, were beginning to subside.
It was the period of the religious <i>fêtes</i> of the Siamese,
and the river was almost incessantly crowded with long
and handsome boats bearing flags, many of them manned
by more than fifty rowers, all in new and bright-coloured
dresses, trying to pass each other, and exciting themselves
by piercing cries and all sorts of noises. In some cases,
however, sweet and agreeable music formed an accompaniment
more grateful to the ear. One boat, belonging
to a mandarin, was escorted by a number of others; it
was remarkable for its elaborate carving and the magnificence
of its gilding, and was carrying yellow stuffs
and other presents to the neighbouring pagodas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The king rarely shows himself in public more than
twice a year, once during the month of October, and a
second time on board his barge, when a procession is
formed consisting of three or four hundred boats, often
containing more than 1200 persons. The effect produced
by this aquatic pageant, with the rowers in their brilliant
dresses, and the multitude of rich flags, is extremely
gorgeous, and such as is only to be witnessed in the East.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see the gaiety and light-heartedness
of the people, in spite of the yoke which weighs on them
and the exorbitant taxes they have to pay; but the
softness of the climate, the native gentleness of the race,
and the long duration of their servitude from generation
to generation, have made them oblivious of the bitterness
and hardships inseparable from despotism.</p>

<p>Everywhere they were making preparations for their
fishing season, for when the waters subside from the
fields, the fish are most plentiful. Dried in the sun, they
furnish food for the whole year, and are also exported in
large quantities. My boat was so encumbered with chests,
boxes, and instruments, that the space left for me was
very confined, and I suffered from heat and want of air;
but these were trifles compared with the mosquitoes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT AYUTHIA.</div>

<p>On arriving at Ayuthia, my rowers conducted me direct
to the excellent Father Larmandy, a French missionary,
by whom I was expected. The good priest received me
with great kindness, and placed at my disposal all he
had to offer in his little house. He employs his leisure
time in the study of natural history and in hunting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
frequently accompanied me in my rambles. As we explored
the woods we talked of our own charming country&mdash;France.</p>

<p class="caption">RUINS OF A PAGODA AT AYUTHIA.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">AYUTHIA.</div>

<p>After a long hunting or rowing expedition, we always,
on our return home, found our repast prepared by my
servant Niou, who excelled in Siamese cookery, and
which our fatigue made us doubly appreciate. Rice
and omelette, or curried fish, bamboo-stalks, haricots,
and other wild vegetables, formed our diet, with the
addition of roast fowls and game when the chase had
been fortunate. Three chickens cost a “fuand” (37
centimes).</p>

<p>The heat was sometimes overwhelming; for a week we
had 90 degrees of Fahrenheit in the shade throughout
the twenty-four hours, but the mosquitoes were fewer in
number, which was a great relief. In our excursions we
visited some ruins amid the woods, and I made a collection
of beautiful butterflies, and found several insects
new to me. When I reach Pakpriau, which is a few
days’ journey to the north, on the frontier of the lake, I
shall find a mountain country, where I am sure of a
plentiful harvest of insects and land shells.</p>

<p>The comet, which I had already observed on my
journey, shone here with increased brilliancy, and it was
difficult not to believe that the extreme heat was owing
to the influence of this meteor.</p>

<p>I drank nothing but tea, hoping by abstinence from
cold water and from all wine and spirits, to escape fever.
So far, my health had certainly never been better, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
even in the north of Russia. Since the ports have been
opened to English and other European vessels everything
has been doubled in price, but still remained cheap as
compared with Europe, and I did not spend more than
a franc a day for my own living and that of my men.
The people flocked to see my collections, and could not
imagine what I should do with so many animals and
insects. I have before mentioned the skilful management
of boats, and the fearlessness in swimming and
diving, displayed by very young children. I used to
amuse myself by offering some of them my cigar-ends
to smoke, in return for which they would run after
butterflies, and bring them to me uninjured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REMARKABLE SPIDER.</div>

<p>I discovered here a sort of spider, which is also, I
believe, found at the Cape, from which a silken thread
may be drawn out by taking hold of the end hanging
from its body. One has but to go on winding; the
thread is very strong, and never breaks.</p>

<p>It requires some time to become accustomed to the
shrill chirpings during the night of myriads of grasshoppers
and other insects, which seem never to sleep.
There appears to be no such thing as silence or repose;
everywhere is a continual stir, the gushing overflow of
life in this exuberant region.</p>

<p>What a contrast between the subdued tints and cold
skies of Europe, and this burning clime and glittering
firmament! How pleasant it was to rise in the early
morning before the glowing sun had begun his course;
and sweeter still in the evening to listen to the thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sounds, the sharp and metallic cries, which seemed as
though an army of goldsmiths were at work!</p>

<p>The people here might be extremely happy, were they
not kept in such abject slavery; bountiful nature, that
second mother, treats them as her spoilt children, and
does all for them. The forests abound with vegetables
and exquisite fruits; the rivers, the lakes, and the ponds
teem with fish; a few bamboos suffice to construct a
house; while the periodical inundations render the lands
wonderfully fertile. Man has but to sow and to plant;
the sun saves him all further trouble; and he neither
knows nor feels the want of all those articles of luxury
which form part of the very existence of a European.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT ARAJIK.</div>

<p>On the 13th November we arrived at a village called
Arajik, where the land was more elevated. Here I killed
several white squirrels, animals which I had not met with
in the neighbourhood of Bangkok. It is only in the
solitude and depth of the woods that one can fully admire
and enter into the sort of harmony and concord which
reigns in the songs of the various birds, forming such a
pleasing kind of symphony that the voice of one is rarely
overpowered by that of another; one can enjoy at once
the general effect and the melodious note of the particular
winged musician we prefer. Scarcely does the
sun begin to gild the tops of the trees, when, alert and
gay, they commence their morning hymn. The martins,
the warblers, the drongos, and the dominicans, respond
to the turtle-doves’ cooing in the highest branches. Music
of a less dulcet nature is discoursed by the aquatic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
rapacious tribes, such as cranes, herons, and kingfishers,
who from time to time utter their piercing cries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO MOUNT PHRABAT.</div>

<p>I procured a guide in the mandarin of the village,
who received me courteously, and offered me, in return
for some trifling presents, a breakfast of rice, fish, and
bananas. I requested his aid in arranging my purposed
visit to Mount Phrabat, a favourite object of pilgrimage
among the Siamese, who resort thither yearly in great
numbers to adore the sacred footprint of Buddha. He
volunteered to accompany me, an offer which I gratefully
accepted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNT PHRABAT.</div>

<p>The next morning, at seven o’clock, my host was
waiting for me at the door, with elephants mounted by
their drivers, and other attendants necessary for our
expedition. At the same hour in the evening we reached
our destination, and, before many minutes had elapsed,
all the inhabitants were informed of our arrival; priests
and mountaineers were all full of curiosity to look at
the stranger. Among the principal people of the place I
distributed some little presents, with which they were
delighted; but my fire-arms and other weapons were
especially the subject of admiration. I paid a visit to
the prince of the mountain, who was detained at home
by illness. He ordered breakfast for me; and, expressing
his regret at not being able to accompany me,
sent four men to serve as guides and assistants. As a
return for his kindness and urbanity I presented him
with a small pistol, which he received with extreme
gratification.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">TEMPLE ON MOUNT PHRABAT.</div>

<p>We proceeded afterwards to the western side of the
mountain, where is the famous temple containing the
footprint of Samona-Kodom, the Buddha of Indo-China.
I was filled with astonishment and admiration on arriving
at this point, and feel utterly incapable of describing the
spectacle which met my view. What convulsion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Nature&mdash;what force could have upheaved those immense
rocks, piled one upon another in such fantastic forms?
Beholding such a chaos, I could well understand how the
imagination of this simple people, who are ignorant of
the true God, should have here discovered signs of the
marvellous, and traces of their false divinities. It was
as if a second and recent Deluge had just abated; this
sight alone was enough to recompense me for all my
fatigues.</p>

<p>On the mountain summit, in the crevices of the rocks,
in the valleys, in the caverns, all around, could be seen
the footprints of animals, those of elephants and tigers
being most strongly marked; but I am convinced that
many of them were formed by antediluvian and unknown
animals. All these creatures, according to the Siamese,
formed the <i>cortège</i> of Buddha in his passage over the
mountain.</p>

<p class="caption">RELICS FOUND ON MOUNT PHRABAT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As for the temple itself, there is nothing remarkable
about it; it is like most of the pagodas in Siam&mdash;on the
one hand unfinished, and on the other in a state of dilapidation;
and it is built of brick, although both stone and
marble abound at Phrabat. The approach to it is by a
flight of large steps, and the walls are covered with little
pieces of coloured glass, forming arabesques in great
variety, which glitter in the sun with striking effect.
The panels and cornices are gilt; but what chiefly
attracts attention by the exquisite workmanship are the
massive ebony doors, inlaid with mother-of-pearl of
different colours, and arranged in beautiful designs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
The interior of the temple does not correspond with the
outside; the floor is covered with silver matting, and
the walls bear traces of gilding, but they are blackened
by time and smoke. A catafalque rises in the centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
surrounded with strips of gilded serge, and there is to
be seen the famous footprint of Buddha. To this sacred
spot the pilgrims bring their offerings, cut paper, cups,
dolls, and an immense number of toys, many of them

<p class="caption">PAGODA AT MOUNT PHRABAT, WHERE IS PRESERVED THE FOOTPRINT OF BUDDHA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After staying a week on the mountain, and adding
many pretty and interesting objects to my collection,
our party returned to Arajik, the Prince of Phrabat
insisting on sending another guide with me, although
my friend the mandarin, with his attendants and elephants,
had kindly remained to escort me back to his
village. There I again partook of his hospitality, and,
taking leave of him the day following, I resumed my
voyage up the river. Before night I arrived at Saraburi,
the chief town of the province of Pakpriau, and the residence
of the governor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SARABURI.</div>

<p>Saraburi is a place of some extent, the population
consisting chiefly of Siamese, Chinese, and Laotian agriculturists;
and consists, like all towns and villages in
Siam, of houses constructed of bamboo. They peep out,
half hidden among the foliage along the banks of the
river; beyond are rice-plantations, and, farther in the
background, extensive forests, inhabited solely by wild
animals.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th we passed Pakpriau,
near which the cataracts begin. The waters were still
high, and we had much trouble to fight against the
current. A little to the north of this town I met with
a poor family of Laotian Christians, of whom the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Father Larmandy had spoken to me.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> We moored our
boat near their house, hoping that it would remain in
safety while I explored the mountains in the neighbourhood,
and visited Patawi, which is the resort of the Laotian
pilgrims, as Phrabat is of the Siamese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILD ANIMALS.</div>

<p>All the country from the banks of the river to the
hills, a distance of about eight or nine miles, and the
whole surface of this mountain range, is covered with
brown iron-ore and aërolites; where they occur in the
greatest abundance, vegetation is scanty and consists
principally of bamboo, but it is rich and varied in those
places where the detritus has formed a thicker surface of
soil. The dense forests furnish gum and oil, which would
be valuable for commerce if the indolent natives could
be prevailed on to collect them. They are, however,
infested with leopards, tigers, and tiger-cats. Two dogs
and a pig were carried off from the immediate vicinity
of the hut of the Christian guardians of our boat during
our stay at Pakpriau; but the following day I had the
pleasure of making the offending leopard pay for the
robbery with his life, and his skin served me for a mat.</p>

<p>Where the soil is damp and sandy I found numerous
traces of these animals, but those of the royal tiger are
more uncommon. During the night the inhabitants dare
not venture out of doors; but in the day-time the
creatures, satisfied with the fruits of their predatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
rambles, skulk into their dens in the recesses of the
woods. One day I went to explore the eastern part of
the chain of Pakpriau, and, becoming excited in the
chase of a wild boar, we soon lost ourselves in the forest.
The animal made his way through the brushwood much
more easily than we could&mdash;encumbered as we were with
guns, hatchets, and boxes&mdash;and we ere long missed the
scent. By the terrified cries of the monkeys we knew we
could not be far from some tiger or leopard, doubtless,
like ourselves, in search of prey; and, as night was
drawing in, it became necessary to retrace our steps
homeward for fear of some disagreeable adventure. With
all our efforts, however, we could not find the path. We
were far from the border of the forest, and were forced to
take up our abode in a tree, among the branches of which
we made a sort of hammock. On the following morning
we regained the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WALK TO PATAWI.</div>

<p>I endeavoured fruitlessly to obtain oxen or elephants
to carry our baggage with a view of exploring the
country, but all beasts of burden were in use for the
rice-harvest. I therefore left my boat and its contents
in charge of the Laotian family, and we set off, like
pilgrims, on foot for Patawi on a fine morning with a
somewhat cloudy sky, which recalled to me the pleasant
autumn days of my own country. My only companions
were Küe and my young Laotian guide. We followed
for three hours, through forests infested with wild beasts,
the road to Korat, and at last reached Patawi. As at
Phrabat, there is a bell, both at the foot of the mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and at the entrance of a long and wide avenue leading
to the pagoda, which the pilgrims ring on arriving, to
inform the good genii of their presence and bespeak a
favourable hearing to their prayers. The mount is
isolated, and about 450 feet in height; its formation
is similar to that of Phrabat, but, although its appearance
is equally grand, it presents distinct points of variation.
Here are not to be seen those masses of rock, piled
one upon another, as if hurled by the giants in a
combat like that fabled of old. Patawi seems to be
composed of one enormous rock, which rises almost
perpendicularly like a wall, excepting the centre portion,
which towards the south hangs over like a roof, projecting
eighteen or twenty feet. At the first glance
might be recognised the action of water upon a soil
originally clay.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">VIEW OF THE MOUNTAINS OF KORAT, TAKEN FROM PATAWI.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO PATAWI.</div>

<p>There are many footprints similar to those of Phrabat,
and in several places are to be seen entire trunks of
trees in a state of petrifaction lying close to growing
individuals of the same species. They have all the
appearance of having been just felled, and it is only on
testing their hardness with a hammer that one feels sure
of not being mistaken. An ascent of several large stone
steps leads, on the left hand, to the pagoda, and, on the
right, to the residence of the Talapoins, or priests, who
are three in number,&mdash;a superior and two assistants,
appointed to watch and pay reverence to the precious
“rays” of Somanakodom. Were the authors who have
written about Buddhism ignorant of the signification of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the word “ray” employed by the Buddhists? Now, in
the Siamese language, the same word which means “ray”
signifies also shadow, and it is through respect for their
deity that the first meaning is applied.</p>

<p>The priests were much surprised to see a “farang”
(foreigner) in their pagoda, but some trifling gifts soon
established me in their good graces. The superior was
particularly charmed with a magnet which I gave him,
and amused himself with it for a long time, uttering
cries of delighted admiration as he saw it attract and
pick up all the little pieces of metal which he placed
near it.</p>

<p>I went to the extreme north of the mount, where
some generous being has kindly had constructed, for the
shelter of travellers, a hall, such as is found in many
places near pagodas. The view here is indescribably
splendid, and I cannot pretend to do justice either with
pen or pencil to the grand scenes which here and
elsewhere were displayed before my eyes. I can but
seize the general effect and some of the details; all I can
promise to do is to introduce nothing which I have not
seen. Hitherto all the views I had seen in Siam had
been limited in extent, but here the beauty of the country
is exhibited in all its splendour. Beneath my feet was a
rich and velvety carpet of brilliant and varied colours;
an immense tract of forest, amidst which the fields of rice
and the unwooded spots appeared like little streaks of
green; beyond, the ground, rising gradually, swells into
hills of different elevations; farther still to the north and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
east, in the form of a semicircle, is the mountain-chain of
Phrabat and that of the kingdom of Muang-Lôm; and in
the extreme distance those of Korat, fully sixty miles
distant. All these join one another, and are, in fact, but
a single range. But how describe the varieties of form
among all these peaks! In one place they seem to melt
into the vapoury rose-tints of the horizon, while nearer at
hand the peculiar structure and colour of the rocks bring
out more strongly the richness of the vegetation; there,
again are deep shadows vying with the deep blue of the
heaven above; everywhere those brilliant sunny lights,
those delicate hues, those warm tones, which make the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> perfectly enchanting. The spectacle is one
which the eye of a painter can seize and revel in, but
which his brush, however skilful, can transfer most imperfectly
to his canvas.</p>

<p>At the sight of this unexpected panorama a cry of
admiration burst simultaneously from all mouths. Even
my poor companions, generally insensible to the beauties
of nature, experienced a moment of ecstacy at the
sublimity of the scene. “Oh! <i>di, di</i>” (beautiful), cried
my young Laotian guide; and when I asked Küe what
he thought of it, “Oh! master,” he replied, in his mixed
jargon of Latin, English, and Siamese, “the Siamese see
Buddha on a stone, and do not see God in these grand
things. I am pleased to have been to Patawi.”</p>

<p>On the opposite side, viz. the south, the picture is
different. Here is a vast plain, which extends from the
base of Patawi and the other mountains beyond Ayuthia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
whose high towers are visible in the distance, 120 miles
off. At the first glance one distinguishes what was
formerly the bed of the sea, this great plain having
taken the place of an ancient gulf: proof of which is
afforded by numerous marine shells, many of which I
collected in a perfect state of preservation; while the
rocks, with their footprints and fossil shells, are indicative
of some great change at a still earlier period.</p>

</a><div><p class="caption">LAOTIAN.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAOTIANS.</div>

<p>Every evening some of the good Laotian mountaineers
came to see the “farang.” These Laotians differ slightly
from the Siamese: they are more slender, have the cheek-bones
more prominent, and have also darker complexions.
They wear their hair long, while the Siamese shave half
of the head, leaving the hair to grow only on the top.
They deserve praise for their intrepidity as hunters, if
they have not that of warriors. Armed with a cutlass
or bow&mdash;with which latter weapon they adroitly launch,
to a distance of one hundred feet, balls of clay hardened
in the sun, they wander about their vast forests, undismayed
by the jaguars and tigers infesting them. The
chase is their principal amusement, and, when they can
procure a gun and a little Chinese powder, they track
the wild boar, or, lying in wait for the tiger or the deer,
perch themselves on a tree or in a little hut raised on
bamboo stakes.</p>

<p>Their poverty borders on misery, but it mainly results
from excessive indolence, for they will only cultivate just
sufficient rice for their support; this done, they pass the
rest of their time in sleep, lounging about the woods, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
making excursions from one village to another, paying
visits to their friends on the way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACCOUNT OF KORAT.</div>

<p>At Patawi I heard much of Korat, which is the capital
of the province of the same name, situated five days’
journey north-east of Pakpriau, that is about 120 miles;
and I determined, if possible, to visit it by and by. It
appears to be a rich country, producing, especially, silk
of good quality. Caoutchouc-trees abound, but are neglected
by the inhabitants, who are probably ignorant
of their value. I brought back a magnificent specimen
of the gum, which was much admired by the English
merchants at Bangkok. Living, according to report, is
fabulously cheap: six fowls may be purchased for a <i>fuang</i>
(37 centimes), 100 eggs for the same sum, and all other
things in proportion. But to get there one has to cross
the famous forest of “the King of the Fire,” which is
visible from the top of Patawi, and it is only in the
dry season that it is safe to attempt this; during the
rains both the water and the atmosphere are fatally
pestilential. The superstitious Siamese do not dare to use
fire-arms there, from fear of attracting evil spirits who
would kill them.</p>

<p>During all the time I spent on the top of the mountain
the chief priest was unremitting in his attentions to
me. He had my luggage carried into his own room,
gave me up his mats to add to mine, and in other ways
practised self-denial to make me as comfortable as was in
his power. The priests complain much of the cold in
the rainy season, and of the torrents which then rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
from the summit of the mountain; they are also greatly
disturbed by the tigers, which, driven from the plains by
the inundations, take refuge on the high ground, and
carry away their dogs and fowls out of the very houses.
But their visits are not confined to that period of the
year. About ten o’clock on the second night of my stay
the dogs suddenly began to utter plaintive howls. “A
tiger! a tiger!” cried my Laotian, who was lying near
me. I started up, seized my gun, and half-opened the
door; but the profound darkness made it impossible to
see anything, or to go out without uselessly exposing
myself. I therefore contented myself with firing off my
gun to frighten the creature. The next morning we
found one of our dogs gone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO BANGKOK.</div>

<p>We scoured the neighbourhood for about a week,
and then set off once more by water for Bangkok,
as I wished to put my collections in order and send
them off.</p>

<p>The places which two months previously had been
deep in water were now dry; and everywhere, around
their dwellings, the people were digging their gardens
and beginning to plant vegetables. The horrible mosquitoes
had reappeared in greater swarms than ever,
and I pitied my poor servants, who, after rowing all
day, could obtain no rest at night.</p>

<p class="caption">SIAMESE NURSE AND BABY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>During the day, especially in the neighbourhood of
Pakpriau, the heat was intense, the thermometer being
ordinarily at 90° Fahrenheit (28° Reaumur) in the shade,
and 140° Fahrenheit (49° Reaumur) in the sun. Luckily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
we had no longer to contend with the current, and our
boat, though heavily laden, proceeded rapidly. We were
about three hours’ sail from Bangkok, when I perceived
a couple of European boats, and in a room built for
travellers near a pagoda I recognised three English
captains of my acquaintance, one of whom had brought
me to Singapore. They were, with their wives, enjoying
a picnic, and, on seeing me, insisted on my joining them
and partaking of the repast.</p>

<p>I reached Bangkok the same day, and was still
uncertain as to a lodging, when M. Wilson, the
courteous Danish Consul, came to me, and kindly offered
the hospitality of his magnificent house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SANITARY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.</div>

<p>I consider the part of the country which I had just
passed through, extremely healthy, except, perhaps,
during the rains. It appears that in this season the
water, flowing down from the mountains and passing over
a quantity of poisonous detritus, becomes impregnated
with mineral substances, gives out pestilential miasmata,
and causes the terrible jungle-fever, which, if it does not
at once carry off the victim, leaves behind it years of
suffering. My journey, as has been seen, took place at
the end of the rainy season and when the floods were
subsiding; some deleterious exhalations, doubtless, still
escaped, and I saw several natives attacked with intermittent
fever, but I had not had an hour’s illness. Ought
I to attribute this immunity to the regimen I observed
and which had been strongly recommended to me&mdash;abstinence,
all but total, from wine and spirits, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
drinking only tea, never cold water? I think so; and I
believe by such a course one is in no great danger.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VOYAGE TO CHANTABOUN.</div>

<div>My intention now was to visit Cambodia, but for this
purpose my little river-boat was of no use. The only
way of going to Chantaboun was by embarking in one of
the small Chinese junks or fishing-vessels, which I accordingly
did on the 28th December, taking with me a
new servant called Nion, a native of Annam, and who,
having been brought up at the college of the Catholic
priests at Bangkok, knew French well enough to be
very useful to me as an interpreter. The boat was
inconveniently small, and we were far from comfortable;
for, besides myself and servant, there were on board two
men, and two children about thirteen. I was much
pleased with the picturesque aspect of all the little
islands in the gulf; but our voyage was far longer than
we expected, three days being its usual duration, while
owing to a strong head-wind it occupied us for eight.
We met with an accident which was fatal to one of our
party, and might have been so to all of us. On the
night of the 31st December our boat was making rapid
way under the influence of a violent wind. I was seated
on the little roof of leaves and interlaced bamboos which
formed a sort of protection to me against the rain and
cold night-air, bidding adieu to the departing year and
welcoming in the new one; praying that it might be a
fortunate one for me, and, above all, that it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
full of blessings for all those dear to me. The night was
dark; we were but two miles from land, and the mountains
loomed black in the distance. The sea alone was
brilliant with that phosphoric light so familiar to all
voyagers on the deep. For a couple of hours we had
been followed by two sharks, who left behind them a
luminous and waving track. All was silent in our boat;
nothing was to be heard but the wind whistling among
the rigging and the rushing of the waves; and I felt at
that midnight hour&mdash;alone, and far from all I loved&mdash;a
sadness which I vainly tried to shake off, and a disquietude
which I could not account for.
<div class="sidenote">A FATAL ACCIDENT.</div>
Suddenly we
felt a violent shock, immediately followed by a second,
and then the vessel remained stationary. Every one
cried out in alarm; the sailors rushed forward; in a
moment the sail was furled and torches lighted, but, sad
to say, one of our number did not answer to his name.
One of the young boys, who had been asleep on deck,
had been thrown into the sea by the shock. Uselessly
we looked for the poor lad, whose body doubtless became
the prey of the sharks. Fortunately for us, only one
side of the boat had touched the rock, and it had then
run aground on the sand; so that after getting it off we
were able to anchor not far from the shore.</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE LION ROCK.</div>

<p>On the 3rd January, 1859, after having crossed the
little gulf of Chantaboun, the sea being at the time
very rough, we came in sight of the famous Lion rock,
which stands out like the extremity of a cape at the
entrance of this port. From a distance it resembles a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
lion couchant, and it is difficult to believe that Nature
unassisted has formed this singular Colossus. The Siamese&mdash;a
superstitious race&mdash;hold this stone in great veneration,
as they do everything that appears to them
extraordinary or marvellous. It is said that the captain
of an English ship, once anchored in the port, seeing
the lion, proposed to buy it, and that, on the governor
of the place refusing the offer, he pitilessly fired all his
guns at <i>the poor animal</i>. This has been recorded in
Siamese verse, with a touching complaint against the
cruelty of the Western barbarians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

the Country&mdash;The Isles of Ko-Man&mdash;Isles of Patates&mdash;The
Island of Ko Kram&mdash;Paknam Ven&mdash;Manner in which the
Apes play with the Crocodiles.</span></p></div>


<p>On the 4th January, at eight o’clock in the morning,
we arrived at the town of Chantaboun, which stands on
the bank of the river, six or seven miles from the
mountain range. The Christian Annamites form nearly
a third of the population, the remainder being composed
of Chinese merchants, and some heathen Annamites and
Siamese. The Annamites are all fishers, who originally
came from Cochin China to fish in the northern part of
the Gulf of Siam, and settled at Chantaboun. Every day,
while the cold weather lasts and the sea is not too rough,
they cast their nets in the little bays on the coast, or in
the sheltered water among the islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EAGLE-WOOD.</div>

<p>The commerce of this province is inconsiderable, compared
with what it might be from its situation; but the
numerous taxes, the grinding exactions of the chiefs, and
the usury of the mandarins, added to the hateful system
of slavery, keep the bulk of the people in a ruinous state
of prostration. However, in spite of a scanty population,
they manage to export to Bangkok a great quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
pepper, chiefly cultivated by the Chinese at the foot
of the mountains; a little sugar and coffee of superior
quality; mats made of rushes, which meet with a ready
sale in China; tobacco, great quantities of salted and dried
fish, dried leeches, and tortoiseshell. Every Siamese
subject, on attaining a certain height, has to pay to
Government an impost or annual tribute equivalent to
six ticals (eighteen francs). The Annamites of Chantaboun
pay this in eagle-wood, and the Siamese in
gamboge; the Chinese in gum-lac, every four years, and
their tribute amounts to four ticals. At the close of the
rainy season the Annamite Christians unite in parties of
fifteen or twenty, and set out under the conduct of an
experienced man, who heads the expedition, and indicates
to the others the trees which contain the eagle-wood; for
all are not equally skilled in distinguishing those which
produce it; a degree of experience is requisite for this,
which can only be acquired by time, and thus much
useless and painful labour is avoided. Some remain in
the mountains, others visit the large islands of Ko-Xang
or Ko-Khut, situated south-east of Chantaboun. The
eagle-wood is hard and speckled, and diffuses a powerful
aromatic odour when burnt. It is used at the incremation
of the bodies of princes and high dignitaries, which
are previously kept in the coffins for a twelvemonth.
The Siamese also employ it as a medicine. The wood
of the tree which yields it&mdash;the <i>Aquilaria Agallocha</i> of
Roxburgh&mdash;is white, and very soft; and the trunk must
be cut down, or split in two, to find the eagle-wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which is in the interior. The Annamites make a kind
of secret of the indications by which they fix upon the
right trees, but the few instructions given me put me on
the right track. I had several cut down, and the result
of my observations was, that this substance is formed in
the cavities of the trees, and that as they grow older it
increases in quantity. Its presence may be pretty surely
ascertained by the peculiar odour emitted, and the hollow
sound given out on striking the trunk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ANNAMITES.</div>

<p>Most of the Chinese merchants are addicted to gambling,
and to the use of opium; but the Annamite Christians are
better conducted. The nature of these Annamites is very
different from that of the Siamese, who are an effeminate
and indolent race, but liberal and hospitable, simple-minded,
and without pride. The Annamites are short in
stature, and thin, lively, and active; they are choleric
and vindictive, and extremely proud; even among relations
there is continual strife and jealousy. The poor
and the wretched meet with no commiseration, but great
respect is accorded to wealth. However, the attachment
of the Christians to their priests and missionaries is very
great, and they do not hesitate to expose themselves to
any dangers in their behalf. I must likewise own that,
in all my dealings with the pagan Annamites, whose
reverence for their ancestors induces them to hold fast
their idolatry, I experienced generosity and kindness
from them, both at Chantaboun and in the islands.</p>

<p class="caption">CHAPEL OF THE MISSION, CHANTABOUN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The missionaries at Bangkok having given me a letter
of introduction to their fellow-labourer at Chantaboun, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
had the pleasure of making acquaintance with the worthy
man, who received me with great cordiality, and placed at
my disposal a room in his modest habitation. The good
Father has resided for more than twenty years at Chantaboun,
with the Annamites whom he has baptized, content
and happy amidst indigence and solitude. I found him,
on my arrival, at the height of felicity: a new brick
chapel, which had been for some time in course of construction,
and the funds required for which had been
saved out of his modest income, was rapidly progressing,
and promised soon to replace the wooden building in
which he then officiated. I passed sixteen days, very
agreeably, with him, sometimes hunting on Mount Sabab,
at other times making excursions on the rivers and
canals. The country greatly resembles the province of
Pakpriau, the plain being, perhaps, still more desert and
uncultivated; but at the foot of the mountains, and in
some of the delightful valleys, pepper is grown in some
quantity by the Chinese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ISLANDS OF THE GULF.</div>

<p>I bought, for twenty-five ticals, a small boat to enable
me to visit the isles of the gulf. The first I landed at
was named Konam-sao; it is in the form of a cone, and
nearly 250 metres<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in height, but only two miles in
circumference. Like all the other islands in this part
of the gulf, it is of volcanic origin. The rocks which
surround it make the access difficult; but the effect
produced by the richness and bright green of the vege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>tation
is charming. The dry season, so agreeable for
European travelling, from the freshness of the nights and
mornings, is in Siam a time of stagnation and death for
all nature; the birds fly to the neighbourhood of houses,
or to the banks of the rivers, which furnish them with
nourishment; rarely does their song come to enchant the
listener; and the fishing-eagle alone utters his hoarse
and piercing cry every time the wind changes. Ants
swarm everywhere, and appear to be, with the mosquitoes
and crickets, the only insects that have escaped destruction.</p>

<p>Nowhere did I find in these islands the slightest trace
of path or stream; and it was extremely difficult to
advance at all through the masses of wild vine and interwoven
branches. I was forced to make my way, hatchet
in hand, and returned at night exhausted with the heat
and fatigue.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the rocks in the elevated parts
of these islands is elementary, and preserves traces of
their ancient deposit beneath the waters. They have,
however, undergone considerable volcanic changes, and
contain a number of veins and irregular deposits of the
class known as contact deposits that are formed near the
junction of stratified rocks with intruded igneous masses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KO-MAN ISLANDS.</div>

<p>On the 26th we set sail for the first of the Ko-Man
islands, for there are three, situated close together, bearing
this name. The largest is only twelve miles from the
coast. Some fishing-eagles, a few black doves, and a
kind of white pigeon were the only winged creatures I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
saw. Iguanas are numerous, and when in the evening
they come out of their retreats, they make such a noise
in walking heavily over the dead leaves and branches,
that one might suppose it caused by animals of a much
larger size.</p>

<p>Toward evening, the tide having fallen, I allowed my
boat to ground on the mud, which I had remarked during
the day to be like a peat-bog impregnated with volcanic
matter; and during the whole night so strong a sulphureous
odour escaped from it, that I imagined myself
to be over a submarine volcano.</p>

<p>On the 28th we passed on to the second island, which
is higher and more picturesque than the other. The rocks
which surround it give it a magnificent effect, especially in
a bright sunlight, when the tide is low. The isles of the
Patates owe their name to the numerous wild tubers found
there.</p>

<p class="caption">VIEW OF PAKNAM ON THE MENAM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I passed several days at Cape Liaut, part of the time
being occupied in exploring the many adjacent islands.
It is the most exquisite part of the gulf, and will bear
comparison, for its beauty, with the strait of Sunda, near
the coast of Java. Two years ago, when the king visited
Chantaboun, they built for him on the shore, at the
extremity of the cape, a house and kiosk, and, in memory
of the event, they also erected on the top of the mountain
a small tower, from which a very extensive view may be
enjoyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUBMARINE VOLCANO.</div>

<p>I also made acquaintance with Ko-Kram, the most
beautiful and the largest of all the islands north of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
gulf between Bangkok and Chantaboun. The whole
island consists of a wooded mountain-range, easy of
access, and containing much oligist iron. On the morning
of the 29th, at sunrise, the breeze lessened, and when we
were about three miles from the strait which separates the
isle of Arec from that of the “Cerfs,” it ceased altogether.
For the last half-hour we were indebted solely to our oars
for the little progress made, being exposed to all the
glare of a burning sun; and the atmosphere was heavy
and suffocating. All of a sudden, to my great astonishment,
the water began to be agitated, and our light boat
was tossed about by the waves. I knew not what to
think, and was seriously alarmed, when our pilot called
out, “Look how the sea boils!” Turning in the direction
indicated, I beheld the sea really in a state of ebullition,
and very shortly afterwards an immense jet of water and
steam, which lasted for several minutes, was thrown into
the air. I had never before witnessed such a phenomenon,
and was now no longer astonished at the powerful smell
of sulphur which had nearly overpowered me in Ko-Man.
It was really a submarine volcano, which burst out more
than a mile from the place where we had anchored three
days before.</p>

<p>On March 1st we reached Ven-Ven, at Paknam-Ven,
the name of the place where the branches of the river
unite. This river, whose width at the mouth is above
three miles, is formed by the union of several streams
flowing from the mountains, as well as by an auxiliary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the Chantaboun river, which, serving as a canal, unites
these two places. Ascending the stream for fourteen or
fifteen miles, a large village is reached, called Bandiana,
but Paknam-Ven is only inhabited by five families of
Chinese fishermen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CROCODILE AND THE APES.</div>

<p>Crocodiles are more numerous in the river at Paknam-Yen
than in that of Chantaboun. I continually saw them
throw themselves from the banks into the water; and it
has frequently happened that careless fishers, or persons
who have imprudently fallen asleep on the shore, have
become their prey, or have afterwards died of the wounds
inflicted by them. This latter has happened twice during
my stay here. It is amusing, however&mdash;for one is interested
in observing the habits of animals all over the
world&mdash;to see the manner in which these creatures catch
the apes, which sometimes take a fancy to play with
them. Close to the bank lies the crocodile, his body in
the water, and only his capacious mouth above the
surface, ready to seize anything that may come within
reach. A troop of apes catch sight of him, seem to
consult together, approach little by little, and commence
their frolics, by turns actors and spectators. One of the
most active or most impudent jumps from branch to
branch till within a respectful distance of the crocodile,
when, hanging by one claw, and with the dexterity
peculiar to these animals, he advances and retires, now
giving his enemy a blow with his paw, at another time
only pretending to do so. The other apes, enjoying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
fun, evidently wish to take a part in it; but the other
branches being too high, they form a sort of chain by
laying hold of each other’s paws, and thus swing backwards
and forwards, while any one of them who comes
within reach of the crocodile torments him to the best of
his ability. Sometimes the terrible jaws suddenly close,
but not upon the audacious ape, who just escapes; then
there are cries of exultation from the tormentors, who
gambol about joyfully. Occasionally, however, the claw
is entrapped, and the victim dragged with the rapidity
of lightning beneath the water, when the whole troop
disperse, groaning and shrieking. The misadventure does
not, however, prevent their recommencing the game a few
days afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO CHANTABOUN.</div>

<div>On the 4th I returned to Chantaboun from my excursions
in the gulf, and resumed charge of my collections,
which, during my absence, I had left at the Custom-house,
and which, to my great satisfaction, had been
taken good care of. The tide was low, and we could not
go up to the town. The sea here is steadily receding
from the coast, and, if some remedy be not found, in a
few years the river will not be navigable even for boats.
Already the junks have some trouble in reaching Chantaboun
even at high water. The inhabitants were fishing
for crabs and mussels on the sand-banks close to the
Custom-house, the <i>employés</i> in which were occupied in the
same pursuit.
<div class="sidenote">COLLECTION OF SHELLS.</div>
The chief official, who, probably hoping for
some small present, had come out to meet me, heard me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
promise a supply of pins and needles to those who would
bring me shells, and encouraged his men to look for
them. In consequence, a large number were brought
me, which, to obtain otherwise, would have cost much
time and trouble.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Life in the Hill-Country&mdash;Mount Sabat&mdash;Hunting&mdash;Tigers&mdash;Serpents&mdash;Rich
Vegetation of Chantaburi.</span></p></div>


<p>Here I am, once more installed in the house of a good
old Chinese, a pepper-planter, whose hospitality I enjoyed
on my first visit to the place, two months ago. His
name is Ihié-How, but in Siamese he is called Apait,
which means <i>uncle</i>. He is a widower with two sons, the
eldest eighteen, a good young man, lively, hardworking,
brave, and persevering. He is already much attached to
me, and is desirous of accompanying me to Cambodia.
Born amidst the mountains, and naturally intelligent,
there are none of the quadrupeds and few of the feathered
tribes found in the district with whose habits he is not
familiar. He fears neither tiger nor elephant. All this,
added to his amiable disposition, made Phrai (that is his
name) a real treasure to me.</p>

<p>Apait has also two brothers who have become Catholics,
and have settled at Chantaboun in order to be near
a Christian place of worship. He himself has never had
any desire to change his religion, because he says if he
did he must forget his deceased parents, for whom he
frequently offers sacrifices. He is badly off, having
incurred a debt of fifty ticals, for which he has to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
ten as yearly interest, the rate in Siam being always
twenty or thirty per cent. Besides this he has various
taxes to pay&mdash;twelve ticals for his two sons, four for his
house, one for his furnace, one for his pig. The tax on
the pepper-field is eight ticals, one on his areca-trees,
one on the betel cultivated by him, and two <i>sellungs</i>
for a cocoa-tree; altogether thirty-nine ticals. His land
brings him in forty after all expenses are paid; what can
he do with the one remaining tical? The unlucky agriculturists
of this kind, and they are many, live on vegetables,
and on the rice which they obtain from the
Siamese in exchange for areca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE IN THE HILL-COUNTRY.</div>

<p>On my return from the islands, I had been detained
nearly ten days at Chantaboun, unable to walk; I had
cut my heel in climbing the rocks on the shore at Ko-Man,
and, as I was constantly barefooted in the salt water,
the wound soon closed. But afterwards I began to suffer
from it; my foot swelled, and I was obliged to re-open
the wound to extract a piece of shell which had remained
in it. As soon as I could leave Chantaboun I hired a
carriage and two buffaloes to take me to the mountain.
I experienced much gratification in finding myself again
amongst these quiet scenes, at once so lovely and so full
of grandeur. Here are valleys intersected by streams of
pure and limpid water; there, small plains, over which
are scattered the modest dwellings of the laborious
Chinese; while, a little in the distance, rises the mountain,
with its imposing rocks, its grand trees, its torrents
and waterfalls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">NOCTURNAL PESTS.</div>

<p>We have already had some storms, for the rainy season
is approaching, vegetation is fresh, and nature animated;
the song of birds and the hum of insects are heard all
around. Apait has resigned to me his bed, if that can
be so styled, which consists merely of a few laths of areca
placed upon four stakes. I have extended my mat upon
this framework, and should enjoy uninterrupted sleep all
night were it not for the swarms of ants which frequently
disturb me by passing over my body, getting under my
clothes and into my beard, and, I almost fancy, would
end by dragging me out, if I did not from time to time
shake them off. Occasionally great spiders and other disgusting
creatures, crawling about under the roof, would
startle me by dropping suddenly on my face.</p>

<p>The heat now is quite endurable, the thermometer
generally marking 80° Fahr. in the morning, and 90° in
the middle of the day. The water of the streams is so
cool and refreshing, that a good morning and evening
ablution makes me comfortable for several hours, as well
as contributing to keep me in health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CHINAMAN’S SACRIFICE.</div>

<p>Last evening Phrai, having gone along with my man
Niou to Chantaboun to buy provisions, brought back to
his father some Chinese bonbons, for which he had paid
half a fuang. The poor old man was delighted with
them, and this morning at daybreak he dressed himself
in his best clothes, on which I asked him what was going
to happen. He immediately began to clean a plank
which was fitted into the wall to serve as a sort of table
or altar. Above this was a drawing of a man dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and putting out his tongue, with claws on his feet and
hands, and with the tail of an ape, intended to represent
his father. He then filled three small cups with tea, put the
bonbons in a fourth, and placed the whole upon the simple
altar; finally, lighting two pieces of odoriferous wood,
he began his devotions. It was a sacrifice to the manes
of his parents, performed with the hope that their souls
would come and taste the good things set before them.</p>

<p>At the entrance of Apait’s garden, in front of his house,
I had made a kind of shed with stakes and branches of
trees, covered with a roof of leaves, where I dried and
prepared my large specimens, such as the long-armed
apes, kids, and horn-bills, as also my collections of insects.
All this has attracted a crowd of inquisitive Siamese and
Chinamen, who come to see the “farang” and admire
his curiosities. We have just passed the Chinese New
Year’s-day, and, as there has been a fête for three days,
all those living at any distance have profited by the
opportunity to visit us. At times Apait’s house and
garden have been crowded with people in their holiday
dresses, many of whom, seeing my instruments, my
naturalist’s case, and different preparations, took me for
a great doctor, and begged for medicines.</p>

<p>Alas! my pretensions are not so high; however, I
treat them on the “Raspail” system; and a little box of
pomade or phial of sedative water will perhaps be represented
in some European museum by an insect or shell
brought to me by these worthy people in return for the
good I would gladly do them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very agreeable, after a fatiguing day’s chase over
hills and amongst dense forests, through which one must
cut one’s way axe in hand, to repose in the evening on
the good Chinaman’s bench in front of his house, shaded
by bananas, cocoanut, and other trees. For the last four
days a violent north wind, fresh in spite of the season,
has been blowing without intermission, breaking asunder
and tearing up by the roots some of the trees on the
higher grounds. This is its farewell visit, for the south-east
wind will now blow for many months.</p>

<p>This evening everything appeared to me more beautiful
and agreeable than usual; the stars shone brightly in the
sky, the moon was clear. Sitting by Apait while his
son played to me some Chinese airs on the bamboo
flute, I thought to what a height of prosperity this
province, even now one of the most interesting and
flourishing in the country, might attain, were it wisely
and intelligently governed, or if European colonists were
to settle and develop its resources. Proximity to the
sea, facility of communication, a rich soil, a healthy and
propitious climate; nothing is wanting to ensure success
to an industrious and enterprising agriculturist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CHINESE SERVANT ENGAGED.</div>


<p>The worthy old Apait has at last consented to allow
his son to enter my service, provided I pay him thirty
ticals, half a year’s wages, in advance. This will enable
him, if he can sell his house and pepper-field, to clear off
his debt and retire to another part of the mountain. Phrai
is delighted to attend me, and to run about the woods all
day, and I am not less pleased with our bargain, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
knowledge of the country, his activity, his intelligence,
and attachment to me, are invaluable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO A WATERFALL.</div>

<p>The heat becomes greater and greater, the thermometer
having risen to 102° Fahr. in the shade; thus hunting is
now a painful, and sometimes impossible, exertion, anywhere
except in the woods. A few days ago I took
advantage of a short spell of cloudy, and consequently
cooler weather, to visit a waterfall I had heard of in
the almost desert district of Prion, twelve miles from
Kombau. After reaching the last-named place, our course
lay for about an hour and a half along a charming valley,
nearly as smooth as a lawn, and as ornamental as a park.
By and by entering a forest, we kept by the banks of a
stream, which, shut in between two mountains and
studded with blocks of granite, increases in size as you
approach its source. Before long we arrived at the fall,
which must be a fine spectacle in the rainy season. It
then pours down from immense perpendicular rocks,
forming as it were a circular peaked wall, nearly thirty
metres in diameter, and twenty metres in height. The
force of the torrent having been broken by the rocky bed
into which it descends, there is another fall of ten feet;
and, lower down, after a third fall of fifteen feet, it passes
into an ample basin, which, like a mirror, reflects the
trees and cliffs around. Even during the dry season the
spring, then running from beneath enormous blocks of
granite, flows in such abundance as to feed several
streams.</p>

<p>I was astonished to see my two servants, heated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
their long walk, bathe in the cold water, and on my
advising them to wait for a little, they replied that the
natives were always accustomed to bathe when hot.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">MONKEYS PLAYING WITH A CROCODILE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We all turned stone-cutters, that is to say, we set to
work to detach the impression of an unknown animal
from the surface of an immense mass of granite rising
up out of one of the mountain torrents. A Chinese had
in January demanded so exorbitant a sum for this, that
I had abandoned the idea, intending to content myself
with an impression in wax, but Phrai proposed to me
to undertake the work, and by our joint labour it was
soon accomplished. The Siamese do not much like my
meddling with their rocks, and their superstition is also
somewhat startled when I happen to kill a white ape,
although when the animal is dead and skinned they are
glad to obtain a cutlet or steak from it, for they attribute
to the flesh of this creature great medicinal virtues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTACKS OF INSECTS.</div>

<p>The rainy season is drawing near, storms become more
and more frequent, and the growling of the thunder is
frightful. Insects are in greater numbers, and the ants,
which are now looking out for a shelter, invade the
dwellings, and are a perfect pest to my collections, not
to speak of myself and my clothes. Several of my
books and maps have been almost devoured in one night.
Fortunately there are no mosquitoes, but to make up for
this there is a small species of leech, which when it
rains quits the streams and infests the woods, rendering
an excursion there, if not impracticable, at all events
very disagreeable. You have constantly to be pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
them off you by dozens, but, as some always escape
observation, you are sure to return home covered with
blood; often my white trousers are dyed as red as
those of a French soldier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILD ANIMALS.</div>

<p>The animals have now become scarcer, which in
different ways is a great disappointment to all, for
Phrai and Niou feasted sumptuously on the flesh of the
apes, and made a profit by selling their gall to the Chinese
doctors in Chantaboun. Hornbills also have turned wild,
so we can find nothing to replenish our larder but an
occasional kid. Large stags feed on the mountain, but
one requires to watch all night to get within range of
them. There are not many birds to be seen, neither
quails, partridges, nor pheasants; and the few wild fowl
which occasionally make their appearance are so difficult
to shoot that it is waste both of time and ammunition to
make the attempt.</p>

<p>In this part of the country the Siamese declare they
cannot cultivate bananas on account of the elephants,
which at certain times come down from the mountains
and devour the leaves, of which they are very fond.
The royal and other tigers abound here; every night
they prowl about in the vicinity of the houses, and in
the mornings we can see the print of their large claws
in the sand and in the clay near streams. By day they
retire to the mountain, where they lurk in close and
inaccessible thickets. Now and then you may get near
enough to one to have a shot at him, but generally,
unless suffering from hunger, they fly at the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of man. A few days ago I saw a young Chinese who
had nineteen wounds on his body made by one of these
animals; he was looking out from a tree about nine feet
high, when the cries of a young kid, tied to another tree
at a short distance, attracted a large tiger. The young
man fired at it, but, though mortally wounded, the
creature, collecting all his strength for a final spring,
leaped on his enemy, seized him and pulled him down,
tearing his flesh frightfully with teeth and claws as
they rolled on the ground. Luckily for the unfortunate
Chinese, it was a dying effort, and in a few moments
more the tiger relaxed its hold and breathed its last.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN OF PRECIOUS STONES.</div>

<p>In the mountains of Chantaboun, and not far from
my present abode, precious stones of fine water occur.
There is even at the east of the town an eminence,
which they call “the mountain of precious stones;” and
it would appear from the account of Mgr. Pallegoix that
at one time they were abundant in that locality, since
in about half an hour he picked up a handful, which is
as much as now can be found in a twelvemonth, nor can
they be purchased at any price.</p>

<p>It seems that I have seriously offended the poor Thaï<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
of Kombau by carrying away the footprints. I have met
several natives who tell me they have broken arms, that
they can no longer work, and will always henceforth be in
poverty; and I find that I am considered to be answerable
for this because I irritated the genius of the mountain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Henceforth they will have a good excuse for
idleness.</p>

<p>The Chinese have equally amused me. They imagine
that some treasure ought to be found beneath the footprints,
and that the block which I have carried away
must possess great medicinal virtues; so Apait and his
friends have been rubbing the under part of the stone
every morning against another piece of granite, and,
collecting carefully the dust that fell from it, have mixed
it with water and drunk it fasting, fully persuaded that
it is a remedy against all ills. Here they say that it is
faith which cures; and it is certain that pills are often
enough administered in the civilized West which have no
more virtue than the granite powder swallowed by old
Apait.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FURNISHED APARTMENTS.</div>

<p>His uncle Thié-ou has disposed of his property for him
for sixty ticals, so that, after paying off his debts, he will
have left, including the sum I gave him for his son’s
services, forty ticals. Here that is enough to make a
man think himself rich to the end of his days: he can
at times regale the souls of his parents with tea and
bonbons, and live himself like a true country mandarin.
Before leaving Kombau the old man secured me another
lodging, for which I had to pay two ticals (six francs)
a month, and I lost nothing in point of comfort by the
change. For “furnished apartments” I think the charge
not unreasonable. The list of furniture is as follows:&mdash;in
the dining-room <i>nothing</i>, in the bed-room an old mat
on a camp-bed. However, this house is cleaner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
larger than the other, and better protected from the
weather: in the first the water came in in all directions.
Then the camp-bed, which is a large one, affords a
pleasant lounge after my hunting expeditions. Besides
which advantages, my new landlord furnishes me with
bananas and vegetables, for which I pay in game when
the chase has been successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DURIAN.</div>

<p>The fruit here is exquisite, particularly the mango,
the mangusteen, the pine-apple, so fragrant and melting
in the mouth, and, what is superior to anything
I ever imagined or tasted, the famous “durian” or
“dourion,” which justly merits the title of king of fruits.
But to enjoy it thoroughly one must have time to
overcome the disgust at first inspired by its smell, which
is so strong that I could not stay in the same place with
it. On first tasting it I thought it like the flesh of some
animal in a state of putrefaction, but after four or five
trials I found the aroma exquisite. The <i>durian</i> is about
two-thirds the size of a jacca, and like it is encased in
a thick and prickly rind, which protects it from the teeth
of squirrels and other nibblers; on opening it there are
to be found ten cells, each containing a kernel larger
than a date, and surrounded by a sort of white, or
sometimes yellowish cream, which is most delicious. By
an odd freak of nature, not only is there the first repugnance
to it to overcome, but if you eat it often, though
with ever so great moderation, you find yourself next day
covered with blotches, as if attacked with measles, so
heating is its nature. A <i>durian</i> picked is never good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
for when fully ripe it falls of itself; when cut open it
must be eaten at once, as it quickly spoils, but otherwise
it will keep for three days. At Bangkok one of them
costs one <i>sellung</i>; at Chantaboun nine may be obtained
for the same sum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT OF A PANTHER.</div>

<p>I had come to the conclusion that there was little
danger in traversing the woods here, and in our search
for butterflies and other insects we often took no other
arms than a hatchet and hunting-knife, while Niou had
become so confident as to go by night with Phrai to lie
in wait for stags. Our sense of security was, however,
rudely shaken when one evening a panther rushed upon
one of the dogs close to my door. The poor animal
uttered a heartrending cry, which brought us all out, as
well as our neighbours, each torch in hand. Finding
themselves face to face with a panther, they in their
turn raised their voices in loud screams; but it was too
late for me to get my gun, for in a moment the beast
was out of reach.</p>

<p>In a few weeks I must say farewell to these beautiful
mountains, never, in all probability, to see them again,
and I think of this with regret; I have been so happy
here, and have so much enjoyed my hunting and my
solitary walks in this comparatively temperate climate,
after my sufferings from the heat and mosquitoes in my
journey northwards.</p>

<p>Thanks to my nearness to the sea on the one side, and
to the mountain region on the other, the period of the
greatest heat passed away without my perceiving it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
I was much surprised at receiving a few days ago a letter
from Bangkok which stated that it had been hotter
weather there than had been known for more than
thirty years. Many of the European residents had been
ill; yet I do not think the climate of Bangkok more
unhealthy than that of other towns of Eastern Asia
within the tropics. But no doubt the want of exercise,
which is there almost impossible, induces illness in many
cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BOA SHOT.</div>

<p>A few days ago I made up my mind to penetrate into
a grotto on Mount Sabab, half-way between Chantaboun
and Kombau, so deep, I am told, that it extends to the
top of the mountain. I set out, accompanied by Phrai
and Niou, furnished with all that was necessary for our
excursion. On reaching the entrance of the grotto we
lighted our torches, and, after scaling a number of blocks
of granite, began our march. Thousands of bats, roused
by the lights, commenced flying round and round us,
flapping our faces with their wings, and extinguishing
our torches every minute. Phrai walked first, trying the
ground with a lance which he held; but we had scarcely
proceeded a hundred paces when he threw himself back
upon me with every mark of terror, crying out, “A
serpent! go back!” As he spoke I perceived an enormous
boa about fifteen feet off, with erect head and open mouth,
ready to dart upon him. My gun being loaded, one
barrel with two bullets, the other with shot, I took aim
and fired off both at once. We were immediately enveloped
in a thick cloud of smoke, and could see nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but prudently beat an instant retreat. We waited
anxiously for some time at the entrance of the grotto,
prepared to do battle with our enemy should he present
himself; but he did not appear. My guide now boldly
lighted a torch, and, furnished with my gun reloaded and
a long rope, went in again alone. We held one end of
the rope, that at the least signal we might fly to his
assistance. For some minutes, which appeared terribly
long, our anxiety was extreme, but equally great were
our relief and gratification when we saw him approach,
drawing after him the rope, to which was attached an
immense boa. The head of the reptile had been shattered
by my fire, and his death had been instantaneous, but
we sought to penetrate no farther into the grotto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIAMESE FÊTE.</div>

<p>I had been told that the Siamese were about to celebrate
a grand fête at a pagoda about three miles off, in honour
of a superior priest who died last year, and whose remains
were now to be burned according to the custom of the
country. I went to see this singular ceremony, hoping
to gain some information respecting the amusements of
this people, and arrived at the place about eight in the
morning, the time for breakfast, or “Kinkao” (rice-eating).
Nearly two thousand Siamese of both sexes
from Chantaboun and the surrounding villages, some in
carriages and some on foot, were scattered over the
ground in the neighbourhood of the pagoda. All wore
new sashes and dresses of brilliant colours, and the effect
of the various motley groups was most striking.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">FUNERAL RITES.</div>

<div>Under a vast roof of planks supported by columns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
forming a kind of shed, bordered by pieces of stuff
covered with grotesque paintings representing men and
animals in the most extraordinary attitudes, was constructed
an imitation rock of coloured pasteboard, on
which was placed a catafalque lavishly decorated with
gilding and carved work, and containing an urn in which
were the precious remains of the priest. Here and there
were arranged pieces of paper and stuff in the form of
flags. Outside the building was prepared the funeral pile,
and at some distance off a platform was erected for the
accommodation of a band of musicians, who played upon
different instruments of the country. Farther away some
women had established a market for the sale of fruit,
bonbons, and arrack, while in another quarter some
Chinamen and Siamese were performing, in a little
theatre run up for the occasion, scenes something in the
style of those exhibited by our strolling actors at fairs.
This fête, which lasted for three days, had nothing at all
in it of a funereal character. I had gone there hoping
to witness something new and remarkable, for these
peculiar rites are only celebrated in honour of sovereigns,
nobles, and other persons of high standing; but I
had omitted to take into consideration the likelihood of
my being myself an object of curiosity to the crowd.

<div class="sidenote">TROUBLESOME CURIOSITY.</div>

Scarcely, however, had I appeared in the pagoda, followed
by Phrai and Niou, when on all sides I heard the exclamation,
“Farang! come and see the farang!” and immediately
both Siamese and Chinamen left their bowls of
rice and pressed about me. I hoped that, once their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
curiosity was gratified, they would leave me in peace,
but instead of that the crowd grew thicker and thicker,
and followed me wherever I went, so that at last it
became almost unbearable, and all the more so as most
of them were already drunk either with opium or arrack,
many, indeed, with both. I quitted the pagoda and was
glad to get into the fresh air again, but the respite was
of short duration. Passing the entrance of a large hut
temporarily built of planks, I saw some chiefs of provinces
sitting at breakfast. The senior of the party
advanced straight towards me, shook me by the hand,
and begged me in a cordial and polite manner to enter;
and I was glad to avail myself of his kind offer, and
take refuge from the troublesome people. My hosts overwhelmed
me with attentions, and forced upon me pastry,
fruit, and bonbons; but the crowd who had followed me
forced their way into the building, and hemmed us in on
all sides; even the roof was covered with gazers. All of
a sudden we heard the walls crack, and the whole of the
back of the hut, yielding under the pressure, fell in, and
people, priests, and chiefs tumbling one upon another, the
scene of confusion was irresistibly comic. I profited by
the opportunity to escape, swearing&mdash;though rather late
in the day&mdash;that they should not catch me again.</div>

<p>I know not to what it is to be attributed, unless it be
the pure air of the mountains and a more active life,
but the mountaineers of Chantaboun appear a much finer
race than the Siamese of the plain, more robust, and of a
darker complexion. Their features, also, are more regular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and I should imagine that they sprang rather from the
Arian than from the Mongolian race. They remind me
of the Siamese and Laotians whom I met with in the
mountains of Pakpriau.</p>

<p>Will the present movement of the nations of Europe
towards the East result in good by introducing into
these lands the blessings of our civilization&mdash;or shall we,
as blind instruments of boundless ambition, come hither
as a scourge, to add to their present miseries? Here
are millions of unhappy creatures in great poverty in the
midst of the richest and most fertile region imaginable;
bowing shamefully under a servile yoke made viler by
despotism and the most barbarous customs; living and
dying in utter ignorance of the only true God!</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FROM THE MOUNTAINS.</div>

<p>I quitted with regret these beautiful mountains, where
I had passed so many happy hours with the poor but
hospitable inhabitants. On the evening before and the
morning of my departure, all the people of the neighbourhood,
Chinese and Siamese, came to say adieu, and offer
me presents of fruits, dried fish, fowls, tobacco, and rice
cooked in various ways with brown sugar, all in greater
quantities than I could possibly carry away. The farewells
of these good mountaineers were touching; they kissed
my hands and feet, and I confess that my eyes were not
dry. They accompanied me to a great distance, begging
me not to forget them, and to pay them another visit.</p>

<p>Immediately on my return to Chantaboun, where I
was again received with open arms by the good Abbé
Raufaing, a French missionary associated as colleague
with Father Larmandy, I began to collect information as
to the best route to Battambong, the chief town of a
province of the same name, which, above a century ago,
was wrested from Cambodia by the Siamese. I made
an agreement with some pagan Annamite fishermen to
give them thirty ticals for taking me from Chantaboun
to Komput, a province of Cambodia. The Annamite
Christians demanded forty ticals, and provisions both
going and returning. After taking leave of the abbé,
who had shown me every possible kindness and attention
on each of my visits, I embarked at noon, in spite of
a heavy rain, as I wished to take advantage of a high
tide. We arrived in the harbour at seven in the evening,
and were detained there for two days by a contrary wind,
too violent to allow us to leave without danger.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">EXCURSION TO BATTAMBONG.</div>

<p>Two days later we reached Ko-Khut, where, again,
pouring rain and a head wind compelled us to anchor
about 100 metres from the shore in a small bay which
was far from promising much security to our little craft.
Our position was not agreeable; our frail bark, rudely
tossed by the furious waves, seemed every moment in
danger of being dashed upon the rocks. Our baggage,
to which we had assigned the best place for preservation
from wet, occupied three-fourths of the boat, and we were
crowded five of us together in the bows, with no better
shelter than some palm-leaves sewn together, through
which the water dripped, and kept us continually soaked.
The rain falling without intermission, we could not keep
the fire alight to cook our rice, and for four days
remained half-lying in the boat, scarcely able to move
in the narrow space left for us, and our clothes clinging
to us with wet. At last, on the fifth day, we had the
pleasure of seeing the sky clear up and the wind change.
About two o’clock in the afternoon, foreseeing a fine
night, and having revived the drooping courage of my
men by a stiff dose of arrack, we weighed anchor and
left Ko-Khut with a fair breeze. It was quite a comfort
to be able to move and breathe freely, and I spent a part
of the night under my little awning of palm-leaves,
enjoying the beauty of the heavens and the rapid
movement of the vessel. At daybreak we perceived,
about ten miles distant, the first of the islands of Koh-Kong.
It is smaller than Koh-Chang, and neither so
imposing in general appearance nor having such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
splendid range of peaked hills. The island is nearly a
desert, but it produces the beautiful cardamom, as also
gamboge, collected from the bamboos, which the natives
split open when hard.</p>

<p class="caption">LEECH-FISHERS ON THE ISLE OF SAMET.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">BEAUTIFUL PROSPECT.</div>

<p>I soon forgot the miseries of the first part of our
voyage, and was amply recompensed by the shifting
scenes of beauty presented to us by the group of islands
we were passing. At length we reached the advanced
posts of the pirates of Komput, from the heights of which
they keep a look-out, and, as soon as a sail comes in
sight, make preparations for an attack. We had no
cause for fear, having no merchandise to tempt them;
and, moreover, we were all well armed. About five in
the evening we cast anchor in a little bay, where we
cooked our rice, and my men lay down to take some
repose, having had none the night previous. We were
a day and a half’s sail from Komput, and at midnight
we resumed our voyage, gently rocked by the waves and
favoured by a light breeze.</p>

<p>After passing the island of Phu-Quoc, which belongs
to Cochin China, the view became more and more beautiful;
land surrounded us on all sides, and we seemed to
be sailing on a lake. The scenery in this gulf is truly
enchanting. Eastward extend the coast and islands of
Cochin China as far as Ita Jienne, and to the north and
west are those of Cambodia, crowned by a mountain
900 metres in height, which is so like Sabab that Phrai
called out to the pilot, “You are taking us back to
Chantaboun; there is Mount Sabab.” We were not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
however, long permitted to enjoy the splendid picture
here displayed before us, for very shortly after our
entrance into the gulf large black clouds, gathering at
the summit of the mountain, by degrees hid it entirely
from view, the thunder growled, and a terrific wind arose,
which hurried our boat along at an extraordinary rate.
The pilot at the helm shook all over, and begged for
arrack to sustain his strength and courage. When the
storm had lasted half an hour a heavy rain began to
descend, and with it the wind moderated. We had now
arrived at the mouth of the river on which Komput is
situated.</p>

<p>It happened to be the day fixed for the King of Cambodia,
then in Komput, to pass in review all the ships
lying in the roads; but for some time he had been
detained by the rough weather in a sort of apartment
erected for him on piles, in a place where the water was
shallow. As we passed the Custom-house, we perceived
the royal <i>cortége</i> advancing towards a large junk, which
his Majesty was having built as a trading-vessel for
Singapore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KOMPUT RIVER.</div>

<p>The river leading to Komput is about 300 metres in
width, but, rising in the neighbouring mountains, its
course is but very limited. The magnificent tree called
by the Siamese Mai-Jakienne, and much prized by the
Chinese for furnishing masts for their junks, is found in
great abundance in the forests bordering its banks.
There are frequently six or seven ships loading at one
time in the roads, so that both Chinese and European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
vessels may be constantly seen going up and down the
stream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KOMPUT.</div>

<p>Though Komput is now the only port of Cambodia,
it is far from being as full of life and bustle as Bangkok,
for the town boasts only 300 houses at most, and a
population scarcely equal to that of Chantaboun. All its
little commerce is supplied by Lower Cochin China, the
ports of which are almost always closed against Europeans,
so that rice, which is imported in a sort of contraband
manner, some tons of gamboge, a little ivory, fish
taken in the lake by the Annamites, a small quantity of
cotton, and the valuable wood above mentioned, constitute
the whole of the commerce of the town; and
I venture to predict that, when the ports of Annam
are thrown open to Europeans, the Chinese merchants
will abandon Komput altogether. And yet, under a
better system of government, this country might supply
a great number of articles, of which I will speak hereafter.
It will not probably be long before what remains
of this unfortunate land will fall under the dominion
of some other power. Possibly, France has her eyes
fixed upon it, with the view of annexing it to her possessions
in Lower Cochin China.</p>

<p>The comparative exemption from heavy taxes and
duties which the Cambodians enjoy, when compared with
the Siamese, made me imagine I should be able to live
here in comfort and abundance; but I was disappointed.
Almost every vice seemed prevalent at Komput&mdash;pride,
insolence, cheating, cowardice, servility, excessive idleness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
are the attributes of this miserable people. It is often
remarked that no one should judge a country through
which he is merely a traveller, and that only those are
capable of doing so who have resided in it for some
time. I admit that, in the first case, one is liable to
make mistakes; but I state here what I see, and give my
impressions as I receive them, leaving it to more experienced
travellers to correct me where I am in error.
Nevertheless, the first impression often proves ineffaceable,
and I may mention that frequently I have trusted less to
my own judgment than to the experience of others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CUSTOM-HOUSE BEGGARS.</div>

<p>There are few travellers in Europe, America, or probably
anywhere else, who have not had cause to complain
of the offensive manner in which custom-house officers
perform their duties, and often exceed them. In Europe
they earn their daily bread by annoying in every possible
way the unfortunates who are compelled, for the sake of
peace, to submit to their insolence and tyranny: here
they gain it by begging; they are licensed beggars. “A
little salt-fish, a little arrack, a little betel, if you please,”&mdash;such
are the petitions; and the more you give, the less
strict will the search be.</p>

<p>After having sailed up the pretty river for about a mile,
we came in sight of a house covered with creepers, and
surmounted by a cross, which indicated the residence of
the Abbé Hestrest, the head of the foreign mission here.
Reader, have you journeyed in foreign lands? Have you
ever for a time, more or less long, been separated from
your friends and relatives&mdash;shut out from civilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
society? Have you been tossed about by tempests or
buffeted by your fellow-men? Have you narrowly escaped
some great danger? Have you been unhappy? Have
you lost some one very dear to you? In one word, have
you <i>suffered</i>? If you have, you will appreciate the feelings
with which the solitary wanderer welcomes the divine
cross, the heart-stirring emblem of his religion. It is to
him a friend, a consoler, a father, a brother; at sight of it
the soul expands, and the more you have suffered the
better you will love it. You kneel down, you pray, you
forget your griefs, and you feel that God is with you.
This is what I did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ABBÉ HESTREST.</div>

<p>I had letters to the Abbé Hestrest from several of
the missionaries in Siam. We therefore anchored, and I
landed; but the nine days’ inactivity to which I had been
forced to submit had so cramped my limbs, that for a
time I had almost lost the use of them, and could
scarcely walk. The abbé received me like a brother, and
offered me accommodation in his humble abode until I
could find lodgings elsewhere. The first piece of news
which he imparted to me was, that France was at war
with Austria. I did not even know that there had been
a difference between the two Governments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTRODUCED TO THE KING.</div>

<p>Scarcely had I landed when the return of the king
from his aquatic excursion was announced. The Abbé
Hestrest conducted me to the banks of the river; and as
soon as his Majesty perceived a stranger by the side of
the priest, he gave orders to his rowers to approach the
shore, and, when within hail, addressed the abbé:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is the stranger with you?”</p>

<p>“Sire, a Frenchman,” replied my companion.</p>

<p>“A Frenchman?” repeated the king, quickly. Then
turning to me, “You are French?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sire,” I answered, in Siamese.</p>

<p>“Monsieur comes from Paris,” said the abbé; “but he
has recently visited Siam.”</p>

<p>“And what does he come to my kingdom for?”</p>

<p>“He has a particular mission, which has nothing to do
with politics; it is merely to see the country. M. Mouhot
will soon wait upon your majesty.”</p>

<p>After a few minutes’ silence, the king, waving his
hand, and saying “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</i>,” passed on.</p>

<p>I was at first afraid that the abbé had made me pass
for a less humble and modest individual than I really
was, and I should be forbidden the kingdom. The very
name of France is full of dread to these poor monarchs;
and this present one lived in daily fear of seeing the
French flag waving in the roads. He is about sixty years
of age, short and stout. He wears his hair cut rather
close, and his countenance is good-natured, mild, and
intelligent.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p class="caption">FAVOURITE WIFE OF THE KING OF CAMBODIA.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE FAVOURITE WIFE.</div>

<p>The king was reclining on a thick cushion in the stern
of his boat, which was of European build. Four rowers
and a dozen young girls were with him; and among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
latter I remarked one, whose features were delicate and
pretty, dressed in the European style, and wearing long
hair. She would have been reckoned a pretty girl anywhere,
and was, I fancy, the favourite, for she was in a
richer costume than the others, and covered with jewels.
She also occupied the place nearest the king, and seemed
to pay great attention to her old adorer. The rest were
fat, with bloated faces and vulgar features, and had their
teeth blackened by betel and arrack. Besides a kind
of petticoat, the corners of which are looped up and
fastened to the sash behind, some wore a tight jacket,
white or blue, buttoning over the chest; and had a red
scarf, which, according to the custom of the Siamese and
Cambodian women, was passed round the body under the
arms, and tied at the bosom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MUN SUY THE PIRATE.</div>

<p>Behind the king’s boat, in no apparent order, and at
long intervals, followed those of several mandarins, who
were not distinguished in any particular manner. One
boat alone, manned by Chinese, and commanded by a
fat man of the same nation, holding in his hand a halberd
surmounted by a crescent, attracted my attention, as it
headed the escort. This man was the famous Mun Suy,
chief of the pirates, and a friend of the king. I was
told that, two years before, he had been compelled,
owing to some iniquities not very well known, to fly
from Amoy, and had arrived at Komput with a hundred
followers, adventurers and rovers of the sea like himself.
After having remained there for some time, keeping the
whole place in terror, and extorting by menaces all he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
could from the market people, he conceived the project
of seizing upon and burning the town, and putting all the
inhabitants to the sword, intending then to retreat with
his spoils, if not strong enough to hold his ground.
Fortunately the plot was discovered, and the Cambodians
from the neighbourhood were armed and assembled
in readiness to defend the place. Mun Suy, not
liking the aspect of affairs, embarked with his band in
his junk, and fell suddenly on Itatais. The market was
sacked in a minute; but the inhabitants, recovering
from their surprise, repulsed the pirates and drove them
back to their vessel with the loss of several men. Mun
Suy then returned to Komput, gained over by presents
first the governor and afterwards the king himself, and
ever since has carried on his piratical acts with impunity,
making his name dreaded by all around. Loud complaints
arose from the neighbouring countries, and the
king, either overawed by the pirate, or for protection
against the Annamites, appointed him commander of the
coast-guard. Henceforth, therefore, he became a licensed
robber, and murder and rapine increased to such a
degree, that the King of Siam sent a naval expedition to
Komput to capture the malefactor and his gang. Two
only were taken and executed. As for their leader, he
was hidden, they say, in the palace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARKET-PLACE OF KOMPUT.</div>

<p>Some days after my arrival I was installed in a house
built by the king’s orders, and at his own expense, for
the accommodation of European merchants, who, however,
do not often visit Komput. Abbé Hestrest conducted me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
through the city. The market-place, occupied chiefly by
the Chinese, is covered by a number of thatched huts
built of bamboo, in which are exhibited for sale, glass,
china, hatchets, knives, Chinese parasols, and other articles
of merchandise, native and foreign. The dealers in fish
and vegetables, and the Chinese <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">restaurateurs</i>, dispute
the street with pigs, hungry dogs, and children of all
ages and both sexes, in a state of nature, and dabbling
in the mud. Mingled with these are native women, repulsively
ugly, and effeminate and emaciated Chinamen,
with haggard cheeks, dragging themselves painfully along
to the opium-merchant’s, the barber’s, or some gambling-house,
three requisites to the very existence of a Chinese.
All the commerce is in their hands; and you meet ten
of them to one native.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO THE KING.</div>

<p>I was introduced by the abbé at several Chinese
houses, where we were most politely received. The king
was expecting a visit from me, and had sent several
persons to find out who I was; his idea being, that I was
an officer of the French army in Cochin China, despatched
from thence to gain information about the country. I
begged M. Hestrest to accompany me to see the king;
for which purpose we proceeded a mile and a half up the
river to Kompong-Bay, which is the Cambodian part of
the town, and the residence of the governor, and where
his Majesty and suite were encamped.</p>

<p>When we arrived he was holding a kind of levée, in
a building constructed of bamboo with some elegance,
and covered with red cloth, but the interior of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
looked more like a theatre than a royal abode. Finding
at the door neither sentinel nor porter, we entered
without being announced. The king was seated on an
old European chair, with two officers on each side of him,
who from time to time offered him, kneeling, a lighted
cigarette, or some betel, which they kept always ready.
At a little distance stood his guards, some holding pikes
ornamented at the top with white tufts; others with
sheathed sabres in their hands. The ministers and
mandarins knelt a few steps below his Majesty. On our
entrance, chairs similar to the king’s were placed for us
close to him. Like his subjects, he generally wears
nothing but the langouti, the native dress. His was
composed of yellow silk, confined at the waist by a
magnificent belt of gold studded with precious stones.
At Cambodia, as at Siam, it is necessary to offer presents,
if one desires to gain the royal favour. I had accordingly
brought with me an English walking-stick gun, as a gift
for the king. It at once attracted his notice.</p>

<p>“Pray show me that cane,” he said, in Cambodian.</p>

<p>I gave it to him.</p>

<p>“Is it loaded?” asked he, seeing it was a fire-arm.</p>

<p>“No, sire.”</p>

<p>He then begged for a cap and snapped it; unscrewed
the barrel and examined it with great attention.</p>

<p>“If it would be agreeable to his Majesty,” I said to
M. Hestrest, “I shall be happy to offer it to the king.”</p>

<p>The abbé interpreted my words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did it cost?” asked the king.</p>

<p>“Sire, I dare not ask M. Mouhot. In Europe no one
tells the price of what he gives.”</p>

<p>The king then begged to look at my watch, and, after
inspecting it attentively, again asked the price. The
abbé then alluded to my design of visiting Udong, the
capital of Cambodia, and of journeying through the
country.</p>

<p>“Go to Udong; go about,” said the king, laughing.
“Very well.” He then asked my name, and tried to
write it; on which I drew out my pocket-book and gave
him one of my cards. He seemed to wish for the
pocket-book, and I presented him with it.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said M. Hestrest, “as M. Mouhot is going to
Udong, perhaps your Majesty will deign to facilitate
his journey.”</p>

<p>“Willingly. How many carriages do you want?”</p>

<p>“Three will be sufficient, sire.”</p>

<p>“And for what day?”</p>

<p>“The day after to-morrow, sire.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AMBASSADOR’S HOTEL.</div>

<p>“Take a note of that, and give orders about it,” said
the king to his secretary. He then rose, and, shaking
hands with us, retired. We returned to our hotel. I
say hotel, for it is the only lodging for strangers; and
M. de Montigny, when ambassador at Komput, lived
there, indications of which were afforded by the inscriptions
scratched on the walls by the sailors belonging to
the expedition, such as “Hotel of the king and ambassadors;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
“Here is lodging for man, horse, and elephant
gratis pro Deo;” “Good beds, sofas, and dining-tables on
the floor;” “Sea-water bathing&mdash;in the river;” “Good
table&mdash;in the market;” “Good wine&mdash;at Singapore;”
“Nothing&mdash;for the servants.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Details respecting Cambodia&mdash;Udong, its present Capital&mdash;Interviews
with the Second King.</span></p></div>


<p>All my preparations for departure having been completed,
the Abbé Hestrest came on the morning of the
day fixed, to invite me to breakfast with him; after
which he offered to take me in his own boat to Kompong-Bay,
where the promised vehicles were to meet us.</p>

<p>When we arrived there, none were to be seen. We
applied to the first mandarin, who, chewing his betel,
displayed his black teeth with a stupid grin, and I then
perceived that I had been duped by these people, who
are always and everywhere false; never yielding but to
force, and holding the very name of a European in detestation.
After various complaints, and remonstrances with
the mandarins, we with great difficulty obtained three
carriages, by courtesy so called; but the dog-cars in use
in Holland would have been more serviceable to me; so
I sent back the three wheelbarrows to the king, with
my compliments, and hired other vehicles for myself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOURNEY TO UDONG.</div>

<p>Udong, the present capital of Cambodia, is situated
north-east of Komput, and is four miles and a half from
that arm of the Mekon which forms the great lake, lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
about 135 miles from Komput as the crow flies. It is
reckoned an eight-days’ journey, travelling with oxen or
buffaloes, and there are eight stations on the way. With
elephants you can accomplish it in half the time; but
only the king, the mandarins, and very wealthy persons
can afford to keep these animals. The conveyances
which I had engaged could scarcely hold my baggage,
so that my men were obliged to make the journey
on foot.</p>

<p>Perceiving in the shops several necklaces, bracelets,
and rings formed of a material like jet, I inquired from
whence it was procured, and was told that it came from
the neighbouring island of Phû Quoc, where it was to
be found in abundance. I afterwards handled a piece of
this substance, and discovered it to be a sort of coal. It
would burn well in a lamp, and greatly resembles the
cannel coal of Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUFFERINGS FROM HEAT.</div>

<p>After traversing a marshy plain, where we knocked
down several aquatic birds, we entered a beautiful forest,
which stretches unbroken to the very gates of Udong.
To cross this marsh I had to put on my hunting-boots,
which I had not worn for some time, and consequently
the leather had hardened so much, that, after two hours’
walking in the heat of the day, the skin was rubbed off
my feet in several places; and I was forced to take off
the boots and continue my journey barefoot. Luckily,
owing to the dry weather and the constant communication
between Komput and the capital, the road was
almost everywhere in good condition. The heat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
intense, and our progress excessively slow; but at length
we reached the first station, where I was lodged in a
large hall, thatched and built of bamboo, which had
been erected for the accommodation of the king and
his suite. At night, guards were stationed at my door
to protect me from robbery; and, thanks to the royal
letter which I carried, I was respectfully treated. On the
following morning I managed, at the cost of a franc of
our money, to hire an elephant to take me as far as the
next station.</p>

<p>From thence I continued my route barefoot, and our
sufferings from the heat exceeded all I had ever imagined
of the effect of the sun in the torrid zone. Its
burning rays, falling on the sandy soil, became intolerable
at ten o’clock in the morning, so that even the natives,
the soles of whose feet were much harder than mine,
could not bear contact with the bare ground, but sought
for tufts of grass to step upon. The oxen could scarcely
move, and showed every sign of pain and exhaustion; and,
in spite of spurring and blows, often refused to stir. The
water in the ponds was not warm, but literally hot;
the whole atmosphere seemed on fire, and all nature
languishing and prostrate. At ten o’clock we halted
until three. We sadly felt the want of drinkable water,
as also did our cattle, which suffered from thirst even
more than ourselves. To make our tea and cook our
rice, we had no resource but the stagnant pools, impregnated
with unwholesome matter by the vomica-nuts
which fall from the surrounding trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">NATURE OF THE ROAD.</div>

<p>The day following I was fortunate enough to obtain
another elephant; but after this there was no more help
to be met with, and the greater part of the ensuing four
days’ journey I performed on foot, my attendants contriving
to perch themselves on the corners of one of
the waggons. At this dry season a broad track in the
middle of the road, which altogether is from twenty-five
to thirty metres in width, is beaten hard by the frequent
passage of vehicles and elephants, and the fine thick dust
arising from it is very annoying. The remainder of the
road is covered with grass and shrubs, and on either
hand is the forest, with its trees tall, straight, and
majestic, surmounted by immense tufts of leaves. The
effect is that of a magnificent avenue; and from the
regularity of the intervals between the trees, one might
almost believe that it had been laid out by the hand
of art.</p>

<p>The stations are equidistant from each other, about
twelve miles apart; and at all of them, besides the old
caravanserais for the shelter of ordinary travellers, new
ones, much more spacious and ornamental, have been
erected for the accommodation of the king. There are
also intermediate resting-places between every two stations,
where travellers can obtain a welcome shelter from the
midday heat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UDONG.</div>

<p>On leaving Komput a low chain of hills came in sight
on our left hand, but everywhere on our route we met
with the same sandy soil, except in a single spot, which
was stony, and contained veins of iron-ore. We passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
through but one village, and there, only, were a few
attempts at cultivation. In no other part of the forest
could I distinguish any traces of its being inhabited.
On approaching the capital, the prospect became more
diversified: we passed fields of rice, cottages encircled
by fruit-gardens, and country houses belonging to the
Cambodian aristocracy, who come here in the evening
for the sake of breathing a purer air than they can find
in the city. As we drew closer to the gates I found the
place to be protected by a large moat, surmounted by
a parapet, and enclosed by a palisade three metres
high. I expected to enter a fortified town, and, as my
countrymen were now engaged in giving a lesson to the
Cochin-Chinese, to be received by a sentinel with fixed
bayonet, and with the startling words, “You cannot
pass.” But seeing no one, I pushed open the gate
and entered. It seemed that I was in the enclosure
surrounding the palace of the second king. The first
object that attracted my attention was a sort of cage,
something between a sentry-box and a pigeon-house, with
a small window at each of the four sides, intended for a
look-out house and signal-station in case of invasion. I
then found myself in the centre of a large square
surrounded by ramparts, and the access to which is by
two gates, one opening on the market-place, and the
other on the country. Within this walled space is, on
one side, the palace of the inferior king, and opposite
are the residence of a younger prince, his brother, and
a pagoda. All these buildings were thatched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>I hoped to find here, as at Komput, an “Hotel for
the king and ambassadors,” but, not seeing any sign
hung out, I bent my steps to a house where many
persons were passing in and out. It was the hall of
justice, and the judges were then sitting. I sent my man
Niou to ask if they would give shelter to a traveller, and
had not long to wait for an answer, for both judges and
accused came out to see me, and I was brought into
the hall, where I was an object of great curiosity, all
crowding round me and asking me what I sold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUMMONED TO THE PALACE.</div>

<p>The news of my arrival soon reached the ears of the
king, and two pages were sent to request me to wait
at once on his Majesty; but my luggage was not yet
forthcoming, and I objected that I could not visit him
in my travelling-dress. “Oh, that is nothing; the king
has no dress at all, and he will be delighted to see you,”
was the reply. Scarcely had my waggons arrived when
a chamberlain, followed by a page, came to say that
the king was waiting for me. I went, therefore, to the
palace, before the entrance of which were a dozen dismounted
cannon, in whose mouths the sparrows had built
their nests. Further off a crowd of vultures were
devouring the remains from the table of the king and
his courtiers. I was ushered into the audience-chamber,
which communicates with his Majesty’s private apartments,
and is paved with large Chinese tiles, the walls
being whitened with chalk. A number of Siamese
pages, fine young men from twenty-five to thirty years
of age, uniformly dressed in a langouti of red silk, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
standing in groups, or seated in Oriental fashion, waiting
the king’s appearance. A few minutes after my arrival
he entered, and every forehead was bowed to the
ground. I rose, and he advanced towards me, with an
air at once easy and distinguished.</p>

<p class="caption">PORTRAIT OF THE SECOND KING OF CAMBODIA<br />

</div>

<div class="sidenote">INTERVIEW WITH THE SECOND KING.</div>

<p>“Sire,” said I, “I had the honour of an interview with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the first King at Komput, and of being favoured by him
with permission to visit Udong.”</p>

<p>“Are you French or English?” he asked, examining
me attentively.</p>

<p>“I am a Frenchman, Sire.”</p>

<p>“You are not a merchant; why do you come to
Cambodia?”</p>

<p>“Sire, I came through Siam to see your country, and
to hunt here, if allowed.”</p>

<p>“Very good. You have been in Siam? I also have
visited Bangkok. Come and see me again.”</p>

<p>“As often as my presence will be agreeable to your
Majesty.”</p>

<p>After a few more minutes’ conversation, the king held
out to me his hand, which I kissed, and I then retired;
but had not proceeded far when several officials ran after
me, exclaiming, “The king is enchanted with you; he
wants to see you often.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">STROLL THROUGH THE CITY.</div>

<p>The following day I devoted to making an investigation
of the city. The houses are built of bamboos or planks,
and the market-place, occupied by the Chinese, is as dirty
as all the others of which I have made mention. The
longest street, or rather the only one, is a mile in length;
and in the environs reside the agriculturists, as well as the
mandarins and other Government officers. The entire
population numbers about 12,000 souls.</p>

<p class="caption">CAMBODIAN CART.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The many Cambodians living in the immediate vicinity,
and, still more, the number of chiefs who resort to Udong
for business or pleasure, or are passing through it on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
way from one province to another, contribute to give
animation to this capital. Every moment I met mandarins,
either borne in litters or on foot, followed by a
crowd of slaves carrying various articles; some, yellow
or scarlet parasols, more or less large according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
rank of the person; others, boxes with betel. I also
encountered horsemen, mounted on pretty, spirited little
animals, richly caparisoned and covered with bells, ambling
along, while a troop of attendants, covered with dust and
sweltering with heat, ran after them. Light carts, drawn
by a couple of small oxen, trotting along rapidly and
noisily, were here and there to be seen. Occasionally
a large elephant passed majestically by. On this side
were numerous processions to the pagoda, marching to
the sound of music; there, again, was a band of ecclesiastics
in single file, seeking alms, draped in their yellow
cloaks, and with the holy vessels on their backs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCENE IN THE COURT OF JUSTICE.</div>

<p>The third day after my arrival at Udong the court of
justice was noisily opened at eight o’clock in the morning;
and the loud voices of the judges and advocates were still
resounding through the hall at five in the afternoon,
having never for an instant been hushed, when suddenly
two pages came out of the court of the palace, crying
out, “The King!” A thunderbolt falling in the hall
could not have caused a greater sensation than this
announcement; there was a general hurryscurry; judges,
advocates, accused, and spectators fled pell-mell, taking
refuge in the corners with their faces to the ground. I
laughed to see the legal functionaries, and the Chinamen
with their long queues, rushing against each other in
their eagerness to escape at the king’s approach. His
Majesty, who was on foot, now appeared at the entrance,
followed by his pages. He waved his hand and called
me to him. Immediately two attendants brought chairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and placed them on the grass opposite to each other. The
king offered me one, and then entered into conversation
with me, while the whole escort and every one near us
remained prostrate on the ground; as far as the eye could
reach, not a soul was standing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION WITH THE SECOND KING.</div>

<p>“How do you like my city?”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> asked the king.</p>

<p>“Sire, it is splendid, and presents an appearance such
as I have never seen elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“All the palaces and pagodas which you see from
here have been built in one year since my return from
Siam: in another year all will be finished. Formerly
Cambodia was very extensive; but the Annamites have
deprived us of many provinces.”</p>

<p>“Sire, the time has arrived for you to retake them.
The French are assailing them on one side; do you
attack them on the other.” His Majesty did not reply,
but offered me a cigar, and inquired my age.</p>

<p>“I am twenty-three,” he said to me. “I recognise
you; you were at Siam with M. de Montigny.”</p>

<p>“No, sire; your Majesty is mistaken. I have only been
in Siam a twelvemonth.”</p>

<p>I then sent for an elegant small Minié rifle, which the
king’s officers had examined in the morning, and presented
it to him, asking him if he would deign to accept it. He
desired me to load it, which I did. “It is done, sire,”
said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it possible? Fire, then.”</p>

<p>He chose for a target a post some way off, and pointed
out the place he wished me to hit. I fired, and immediately
his Majesty and the pages went to satisfy themselves
that the aim was true.</p>

<p>“When do you wish to leave Udong?”</p>

<p>“Sire, I should like to depart, the day after to-morrow,
for Pinhalu and the other provinces.”</p>

<p>“If you could remain one day longer, it would give
me pleasure. To-morrow you will dine with me; on the
day after I will take you to see the town of the first king,
and in the evening we will have a play.”</p>

<p>The play, I thought, will be curious, and therefore I
decided to remain; and, after I had thanked the king for
his kindness to me, he shook hands with me, and we
separated. Evidently I was in high favour. On the
following morning messengers came from the king to
place horses at my disposal, should I be inclined to ride;
but the heat was too great. About four in the afternoon
he again did me the honour of sending a horse to bring
me to the palace. I wore a white coat, vest, and trousers;
a helmet made of cork,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> after the fashion of the ancient
Romans, and covered with white muslin, completed my
singular toilet.</p>


<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO THE SECOND KING.</div>

<p>I was introduced by the chamberlain into one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
king’s private apartments, a pretty room furnished in the
European style. His Majesty sat waiting for me, smoking,
near a table covered with refreshments; and as soon as I
entered he rose, and holding out his hand, and smiling,
he begged me to sit down and begin my repast. I
perceived that he intended, after the manner of the
country, to do me honour by being present at the meal
without partaking of it himself.</p>

<p>After introducing me, with much courtesy and friendliness,
to his brother, a young man of fifteen, who was
kneeling by his side, the king said, “I have had this fowl
and duck cooked in the European fashion; tell me if they
are to your taste.”</p>

<p>All had been really exceedingly well prepared; the
fish, particularly, was capital.</p>

<p>“Good brandy,” said the king, in English (the only
words he knew in that language), as he pointed to a bottle
of cognac. “Drink,” continued he.</p>

<p>The attendants then placed before me jellies and
exquisitely preserved fruits, bananas, and excellent mangoes.
Afterwards tea was served, of which the king also
partook, having first offered me a Manilla cigar. He then
wound up a musical-box, and put it on the table. The
first air gave me great pleasure, all the more because
I was unprepared to hear it in a royal palace. It was
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>. The king took my start and look of
astonishment for admiration. “Do you know that air?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Then followed another scarcely less familiar, the air
of the Girondins, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mourir pour la patrie</i>.</p>

<p>“Do you also know that?”</p>

<p>As an answer, I accompanied the air with the words.
“Does your Majesty like this air?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Not so well as the first.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty is right; most European sovereigns
have the same taste.”</p>

<p>“Napoleon, for instance?”</p>

<p>“Napoleon, particularly.”</p>

<p>My Annamite was with me, and filled the office of
interpreter, with a perfect tact which pleased the king.
The young prince now asked permission to retire, and
saluted his brother by bowing to the earth and raising
his clasped hands above his head. The king desired him
to return the next morning, and accompany us to the
palace of the first king; and the prince, passing out
into the courtyard, was lifted astride on the shoulders of
an attendant, and carried to his palace.</p>

<p>His Majesty then displayed to me his European
furniture, mahogany tables covered with china vases and
other ornaments of a commonplace description; above
all, he pointed out, as worthy of notice, two old looking-glasses
in gilt frames, a sofa, and various similar articles.
“I am but beginning,” said he; “in a few years my
palace will be beautiful.”</p>

<p>He afterwards took me into his garden, where were
some rare and curious plants, and a miniature artificial
rock. Then, on returning to the sitting-room, he con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>ducted
me past the inmates of his seraglio, at least a
hundred in number, whom curiosity had brought out to
gaze at the stranger.</p>

<p>“You are the first foreigner who has ever been
admitted here,” he said to me. “In Cambodia, as in
Siam, no one but the people on duty can penetrate into
the king’s private apartments.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SECOND KING.</div>

<p>I thanked him for the honour he had done me, and
took leave. He told me to ask for all I wanted, and he
would refuse no request. The only thing I desired was to
have my journey facilitated; and to this end I begged
him to furnish me with letters to the chiefs of the
different provinces of his dominions, and one or two
elephants. This he promised to do. This young sovereign
is the presumptive heir to the crown. His father,
who owes his throne to the King of Siam, is not permitted
by that monarch to leave his own country; and as a
guarantee of his fidelity, one or two of his sons have
always been retained as hostages at the Siamese Court.
It was thus that the young king passed many years at
Bangkok, where, doubtless, he learnt the art of government,
and whence he was not allowed to return to his
own kingdom till it was apparent that he would prove a
submissive and obedient tributary. Another brother, a
prince of twenty-one, paid me a visit at night, unknown
to his relatives, hoping to receive a present. He was
very childish for his age, and wanted everything he saw;
he was, however, gentle and amiable, and of superior
manners.</p>

<p class="caption">A PAGE OF THE KING OF CAMBODIA.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">AGAIN SUMMONED TO THE PALACE.</div>

<p>The next morning the king sent for me at ten o’clock.
I found him seated on a sofa in the reception-hall, giving
orders to his pages about the order of march to be
observed in going and returning. When all was ready,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
he entered a sedan-chair or palanquin magnificently
carved and painted. His head and feet were bare, his
hair cut in the Siamese fashion, and he wore a superb
langouti of yellow silk, with a girdle of the same material,
but of a lighter shade. The palanquin was borne on the
shoulders of four attendants, and another held up an
enormous red parasol with a gilt handle upwards of
twelve feet long. The youngest prince, carrying the
king’s sabre, walked beside him; I was on the other
side, and his Majesty often turned towards me to point
out any striking object, and trying to read in my face
what I thought of the effect produced on the people by
his appearance. He sat in a careless attitude, one leg
hanging out of the palanquin, and with his elbow resting
on the morocco cushions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ROYAL PROCESSION.</div>

<p>At the approach of the procession all the collected
population bowed themselves to the ground. In front
marched three lictors, bearing in their hands bundles of
rattans (the emblems of power); behind the palanquin
came, two and two, the chamberlains and pages, numbering
more than thirty, all dressed in red, and bearing on their
shoulders pikes, sabres, or guns in cases. In this order
we arrived at the outer entrance of the palace of the first
king.</p>

<p>His Majesty here descended from his palanquin, and,
still in the same order of march, we proceeded along an
avenue about half a mile in length, planted with young
trees, and bounded on either side by a wooden fence.
The ground slopes gradually from hence, and is laid out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in gardens and lawns, encircling which are a hundred
little cottages with walls of clay and thatched roofs.
“All these houses are inhabited by my father’s wives;
there is not a man in them,” said the young king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PALACE.</div>

<p>Farther on was a lake surrounded with rich and
luxuriant verdure. On its banks, buried in foliage, which
is reflected in the clear water, stands the royal residence,
part of which is of bamboo, the rest being whitewashed.
We went through several apartments, in which poor
Annamite women were weaving silk, and, after passing
in front of the treasury and the king’s magazines, finally
reached a vast hall which, here, is peculiarly called the
palace. The interior does not come up to what might
be expected from an outside view. It is stocked like a
bazaar with glass bottles, vases filled with artificial flowers
and covered by glass shades, cushions of all colours and
sizes, boxes, slippers, old sofas, looking-glasses, washing-stands,
and a variety of European articles, piled upon
tables and shelves, and on the floor. As the young king
was to spend the day at the palace, he now dismissed
me, appointing one of his chamberlains to escort me
home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PLAY.</div>

<p>A little after sunset the people collected in crowds to
witness the play which was to be performed on the king’s
return, expected at seven o’clock. The multitude was so
dense that not a single inch of ground in the courtyard
was unoccupied, and the walls, even, were all covered.
At these festivities the people are apparently permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to depart from the customary posture of humility, for
every one was seated in Oriental fashion. The play was
simply a phantasmagoria tolerably well managed, and
accompanied by music more noisy than harmonious; but
which appeared perfectly to satisfy the public.</p>

<p>On the 2nd July, having taken our usual morning repast
of rice, we were ready to set off, and were only waiting
for the waggons and elephants promised me by the king.
They were not long in arriving, and we passed through
the city amidst an immense crowd of people who had
come from all quarters to witness our departure. We
were mounted on our elephants, and escorted by several
of the royal pages as far as the road to Pinhalú; all the
population prostrating themselves as before the king,
doubtless because he had paid me such marked attention.</p>

<p>We proceeded, at the rate of about three miles an hour,
on a good road, which was in some places raised more
than ten feet above the level of the wooded but marshy
plain which extends to the great arm of the Mekon.</p>

<p>Now and then we crossed handsome bridges built of
stone or wood, which certainly give a more favourable
idea of the state of engineering in Cambodia than in
Siam; for, even at Bangkok, the streams and canals are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
spanned by thin, narrow planks, or by trunks of trees
thrown across by the inhabitants, and not by the
authorities.</p>

<p>About two kilometres from Udong is a sort of rampart
formed of earth, in the form of a horseshoe. It environs
a portion of the town, and was intended to defend the
place in case of an invasion by the Annamites, an event
which is yearly looked for at the time of the floods.</p>

<p>We met many pedestrians laden, probably, with
provisions for the market. The road is bordered with
miserable bamboo huts, like poultry-houses, raised on
piles, which serve for dwellings for the unlucky Thiâmes,
who were transported here by the king, a twelvemonth
since, from the plains to the east of the Mekon, as a
punishment for an attempted revolt which they were
accused of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PINHALU.</div>

<p>We arrived early the same day at Pinhalú, a village
of some size, situated on the right bank of the stream,
many of the inhabitants of which are the descendants of
Portuguese and Annamite refugees. It is the residence
of a French bishop, Monsignor Miche, Vicar-apostolic of
the mission to Cambodia and Laos. He was absent, but
I found three good and benevolent missionaries, who
begged me to wait for his return, and received me in
that cordial and affectionate manner which is so pleasant
to meet with in a strange land, and especially from
fellow-countrymen. M. Fontaine, the eldest of the three,
though still in the prime of life, had been a missionary for
nearly twenty years. He was formerly attached to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
mission at Cochin China, and I had seen him on my visit
to Bangkok, where he remained some time before going
to Cambodia. He was then feeble and suffering, but I
was glad now to find him stronger and full of animation.
I felt a true respect for this worthy man; may there be
many labourers in the same vocation resembling him!</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH MISSIONARIES.</div>

<p>The second priest, M. Arnoux, was not only a fellow-countryman,
but our birthplaces were only distant from
each other a few leagues. He was born in the depart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>ment
of Russey, and I in that of Montbéliard (Doubs), so
that I had two reasons for being drawn towards him.
He belongs to the Cochin China mission, and had come
from among the savage Stiêns to renew his stock of
provisions; but, having been attacked by dysentery,
owing to the fatigue of the journey, he had been unable
to return. These two valiant soldiers of the Church, with
good and pure hearts, iron wills, and the energy and
courage of heroes, or, rather, of martyrs, had formerly
lived together, at a distant station, among the savage
Benous, and had suffered there terribly from fevers,
dysentery, scurvy, and other diseases. Among the fifty
Annamites who were with them in that refuge of Christianity,
there frequently was not a single one able to
cook their rice, all being in the hospital. On hearing
these brave and worthy sons of our dear country describe
their past and present misery, I was sometimes as much
amused as affected, with so much liveliness was the narration
given; but it is the characteristic of our dauntless
nation that her sons suffer and die gaily, and with smiles
on their lips.</p>

<p>Four days flew by rapidly in the society of these
friends, by whom I was detained till the return of their
bishop, whose acquaintance I much desired to make. I
knew that I should find in him a man of very superior
character; but I did not expect to find in this eminent
missionary a simplicity and humility equal to his talents
and strength of mind. Monsignor Miche is short and
slight; but under his frail exterior exist extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
energy and endurance. The annals of the Cochin China
mission, as well as of that to Cambodia, must contain
many a page filled with the noble actions of this distinguished
pioneer of Christianity, and with the persecution
and captivity he has suffered. When a simple missionary,
he and one of his companions were imprisoned and beaten
with rods&mdash;a fearful punishment, which, at each blow, cut
open the flesh and made the blood flow. They were
then conducted to their cells, in order that the torture
might be repeated on the following day, when their
wounds were beginning to heal, for the Annamites are
skilled in the refinements of cruelty.</p>

<p>“The suffering is dreadful,” said his companion to
M. Miche; “I do not believe I can bear it a second
time.”</p>

<p>“Be easy,” he replied; “I will ask to receive your
blows for you.” He did request this, and actually did
receive them.</p>

<p>Here the missionary is everything to the poor Christians,
physician to the body as well as the soul; and every day
he passes hours in listening to their disputes, and acting
as peacemaker.</p>

<p>The rule here is, that if a man cannot pay a debt, he
and his family become the slaves of the creditor. “You
are my slave,” said a person to a young girl whom he met.</p>

<p>“How so? I do not know you.”</p>

<p>“Your father owed me money, and never paid me.”</p>

<p>“I never knew my father; he died before I was born.”</p>

<p>“Will you go to law?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The man then consulted some mandarin, gave him
a present, promised him others, won his cause, and the
unfortunate girl, having no means to do the same, became
a slave. It is the story of Appius and Virginia reproduced
in the East. Corruption and barbarity are general in
Cambodia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOME OF THE STIENS.</div>

<p>I now determined to visit the savage tribes living to
the east of the great river, 104° east long. from Paris,
and of whom I had heard M. Arnoux speak; he had promised
me a welcome from M. Guilloux, the missionary
there. I sent Niou back to Udong to ask the king for
the letter he had promised. He soon returned with it
in due form, and on the 22nd July I quitted Pinhalú in
a small boat with two rowers, which I hired as far as
Pemptiélan, situated on the Mekon river, about forty
miles to the north of Pénom-Peuh.</p>

<p>Ever since I had been in Cambodia my servants had
been in a state of alarm, and it reached its height when
I informed them that we were about to set out on an
expedition to the savage tribes. Cambodia is much
dreaded by the Siamese: and the mountains, and, still
more, the forests, inhabited by the Stiêns, have a reputation
for unhealthiness, among both Cambodians and
Annamites, equal to that which, in France, is enjoyed by
Cayenne, whither condemned political offenders and malefactors
from the galleys are sent to die. I doubt very
much if I could have met with any other men who would
have remained with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>On descending the great arm of the Mekon, which is
here 1200 metres wide, I was astonished at seeing the
current running from south to north instead of following
the course of the river into which it falls. The banks of
this river are peopled by the same race of Thiâmes
whom I saw on my route from Udong to Pinhalú.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">LAKE OF CAMBODIA.</div>

<p>During more than five months of the year, the great
lake of Cambodia, Touli-Sap, covers an immense space of
ground: after that period there is a diminution in depth
owing to the great evaporation, but its width remains
nearly unaltered. Although its waters increase in volume
during the rainy season, these are not swelled by the
streams from the mountains on its western boundary,
but by the strength of the current from the Mekon
which pours into it its overflow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE THIAMES.</div>

<p>As for the Malays, or Thiâmes, as the Cambodians call
them, I made endeavours to investigate their origin, and
also the traces which I supposed to exist in Cambodia of
Israelite migrations. Monsignor Miche told me that he
had never met with any Jews in the country, but that he
had found, in one of the sacred books of the Cambodians,
the judgment of Solomon exactly recorded, and attributed
to one of their kings who had become a god, after having
been, according to their ideas of metempsychosis, an ape,
an elephant, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Thiâmes are the same as the ancient Tsiampois;
but these Tsiampois, whence came they? What is the
origin of this strange people, whom the conquests of the
Annamites drove back, doubtless from the south of Cochin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
China to Cambodia, but who form alliances with neither
of the races whose country they share, and who preserve
their own language, manners, and religion? On
looking over the Life of the Abbé Gagelin, one of the
martyrs in Cochin China, written with talent and eloquence
by the learned Abbé Jacquenet, I found what
I had long been in search of, and I extract the following
<span class="lock">passage:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In the midst of Cochin China properly so called,
between the seas which surround it on all sides except
on the west, where it touches Cambodia, is the ancient
kingdom of Tsiampa. The inhabitants are a singular
race; they never ally themselves with the Cochin Chinese,
their character, religion, and language raising insuperable
barriers between them. On submitting to the yoke of
the conqueror, the sovereign simply changed his title
from king to mandarin, but the constitution and ancient
laws remained in full vigour in his states, and he continued
to exercise absolute authority over his subjects.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It is
difficult for strangers to observe the domestic life of these
people; but it is said that they practise circumcision,
observe the Sabbath, abstain from the flesh of pork, and
offer the sacrifice of the red calf.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It is even said that
they possess the Pentateuch, but this I dare not affirm.
Strangely, however, all these observances, imitated no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
knows whence, are only vain ceremonies to these men,
enigmas to which they have lost the clue. They have
not even retained a distinct idea of the true God; and
their worship, although mixed up with some of the rites
of the Mosaic law, is a real idolatry. One wonders whence
come this people. Are they an ancient colony of Ishmaelites
or Idumeans? Are they an offshoot of Judaism
thrown on to these shores? These questions are worthy
of consideration. However it may be, their care to preserve
their traditions pure from all alloy, and their
obstinate persistence in error, render them worthy of a
Jewish origin. The Jews, in the days of their prosperity,
did not guard their faith more religiously than do these
people theirs in their new Palestine; and, in order to
avoid intercourse with strangers, and escape the proselyting
efforts of the missionaries, they have relinquished
to the Cochin Chinese all the advantages of the seashore,
and retired to the mountains and the interior of
the country.</p>

<p>“On the eve of the Assumption I bent my steps towards
the interior, to visit the Tsiampois, and find out whether
they would still reject the good news of salvation. After
a few days’ walking I arrived, I dare not say at one of
their towns, but at one of their principal dwelling-places.
These singular people have retained none of the power
ascribed to them by ancient tradition, according to which
they have held sway over Cambodia, Cochin China, Tong
King, and even Pegu, as far as the province of Canton.
Their governor has to pay a small tribute, but remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
as much ruler over his own people as before the conquest.</p>

<p>“I was anxious to find out the truth about their religion,
but could only obtain scraps of tradition which a Christian
could manage to put into form. One of these traditions
teaches that the founder of their religion was a great
man, a famous warrior, who worked marvels with a rod
which is carefully preserved among them. I had the
signal honour of being allowed to see it: it is about ten
feet long, and is covered with a kind of red stuff, studded
with yellow stars, having at one end an iron blade about
an inch in length. With this rod in his hand, the founder
of their faith controlled the elements, divided the waters,
and calmed tempests; and it is pretended that this instrument
still preserves its virtue of working miracles. They
have, they say, a precious volume left them by this great
chief. Their religious practices consist in the scrupulous
observance of a seventh day of rest, in abstaining from
certain food, especially pork, which they hold in abhorrence,
and in the rite of circumcision which the male
children undergo at the age of fifteen. When the girls
arrive at the same age, the hair over the forehead is cut.
They preserve a remembrance of certain days on which
it was not lawful to work, nor even to leave their houses
before sunset. Their prayers end with the word ‘Amin,’
much the same as the Amen of the Hebrews. They seem
to have lost the idea of a Creator of heaven and earth, but
worship the sky and the stars; there are, however, no
idols in their temples. The priests who officiate there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
light candles on a table, burn incense, and, at certain
times of the year, as in April and May, pass a month
without going out of doors. Clear away from this
account,” says the Abbé Jacquenet, “the mists of ages,
and it is easy to recognise the traces of an Israelitish
origin. Comparing this with other missionary accounts,
and the traces of these people found elsewhere, who will
doubt that the torch of truth, which shone formerly between
the great sea and Jordan, also shed its light over
the extreme East? Whether, to explain these facts, we
consider the commercial relations of the Jews with these
countries, particularly when, in the height of their power,
the combined fleets of Solomon and Hiram went to seek
the treasures of Ophir (a generic name used perhaps to
designate the two Indies), or whether we come lower
down, to the dispersion of the Ten Tribes, who, instead of
returning from captivity, set out from the banks of the
Euphrates and reached the shores of the ocean&mdash;whatever
ground of explanation we resolve upon, the shining of the
light of revelation in the far East is not the less incontestable.
Join to this light, those traditional truths carried
with them as a sacred heritage by the families who were
dispersed at Babel; and say what becomes of the extravagant
praises lavished on Eastern wisdom by the sect of
philosophers? Passion and presumptuous ignorance joining
hands tried to oppose wisdom from on high, and have left
behind only a faint reflection of it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">The Great Bazaar of Cambodia, Penom-Peuh&mdash;The River

the Neighbouring Country inhabited by the Savage Stiêns.</span></p></div>


<p>We left Pinhalú at eleven, and by evening had reached
the great bazaar of Cambodia, the distance being about
eighteen miles. I had little to buy, for M. Miche and
M. Arnoux had insisted on filling my boat with rice and
dried fish, sufficient to last not only for my voyage but
during the whole period I proposed to remain among the
Stiêns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BAZAAR OF CAMBODIA.</div>

<p>I stopped a whole day to see the city, and make a
few purchases of glass, brass wire, and cotton yarn, articles
which would be useful as barter among the savages. The
town is situated at the confluence of two great streams,
and contains about 10,000 inhabitants, almost all Chinese;
but it has a floating population of more than double that
number, composed of Cambodians and Cochin-Chinese,
living in their boats. It was the time when most of the
fishermen, returning from the great lake, stop at Penom-Peuh
to sell part of their fish, and when a crowd of small
merchants flock there to buy cotton, which is gathered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
before the rains. Having traversed the city, which was
long and dirty, I arrived at an eminence on which was
built a pagoda, possessing neither beauty nor interest,
but from whence there is an extensive view over a large
tract of country.</p>

<p>On one side extend, like two long and wide ribands,
across an immense wooded plain, the Mekon and its
tributary; on the other, another plain and thick forest,
bounded on the north-west and south by small chains of
mountains.</p>

<p>Although the missionaries often pass through Penom-Peuh,
my presence excited much curiosity among the
people. The war in Cochin-China was the subject of all
conversations, and in every one’s thoughts. The reports
of the Chinese and Annamites who had seen the taking
of the town of Saigou were not flattering to the pride of
a Frenchman. I had not seen the glorious bulletins of
our Admiral, but had the pain of hearing our enemies
stigmatise us as barbarians, and, describing the burning
of the market, and the conduct of the soldiery towards
defenceless women, speak of it as “the behaviour of
savages.” Thus the evil deeds of a less civilized ally
were visited upon us, and our whole nation judged of
by isolated acts, all but inevitable in time of war,
especially in a country where the soldier suffers from
the climate and privations of all kinds.</p>

<p>The people, perhaps the most corrupted in all the East,
expected to find in us men superior, morally, as well
as intellectually and physically; and I dare to flatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
myself that before long they will learn to distinguish
between the characters of the true French soldiers and
their allies, and that in every respect we shall recover
our ancient prestige.</p>

<p>The next day, descending the river toward the southern
extremity of the city, we passed a floating town, composed
of more than 500 boats, most of them of large size.
They serve as an entrepôt for some merchants, and residences
for others. All their money and the greater part
of their merchandize is here kept, that, in case of alarm,
they may be ready to take flight at a moment’s
warning.</p>

<p class="caption">THE RIVER MEKON AT PENOM-PEUH.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE MEKON.</div>

<p>Shortly afterwards we entered the Mekon, which was
only now beginning to rise, as, throughout the country the
drought had been excessive, lasting much longer than
usual. This great river, the name of which signifies
“Mother of Rivers,” recalled to my mind the Menam,
north of Bangkok, but its aspect is less gay; yet there
is something very imposing in this expanse of water
running with all the rapidity of a torrent. A few boats,
scarcely distinguishable, toiled along: the banks, generally
about 18 or 20 feet high, seemed almost deserted; and
the forests were indistinctly discernible more than a mile
beyond. In Siam the elegant foliage of the bamboos
and palm-trees shows out strikingly against the blue sky,
while the songs of the birds charm the ear: here, shoals
of porpoises sail along with their noses to the wind, frequently
bounding out of the water; pelicans sport on the
margins of the stream, and herons and storks fly silently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
from among the reeds at our approach. These are the
sole objects of interest.</p>

<p>We passed the great island of Ko-Sutin, which is distant
about 40 miles from Penom-Peuh, after five days’ difficult
and laborious travelling. The current was so strong
that at every turn in the stream we were obliged, in
addition to redoubling our efforts at the oars, to hold on
by the reeds to prevent our being carried away.</p>

<p>The farther north we went the more rapidly the stream
ran; so that when the waters are high two miles a day
are the usual rate of progress; and it is a common occurrence
for the boatmen to seek fuel for their evening fire
in the same spot where they had cooked their rice in the
morning.</p>

<p>About 25 or 30 leagues north of Ko-Sutin, on the confines
of Laos, commence the rapids and cataracts: it is
then necessary to leave the boats and take to pirogues,
which, as well as the luggage, have often to be carried
on men’s backs. I made a halt of only a few hours, in
order to see another voluntary exile, M. Cordier, a priest
of great worth, from the Cambodian mission, who resides
here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. CORDIER THE MISSIONARY.</div>

<p>I felt great compassion for this good man, on entering
the chapel which he had built, and seeing the poverty
and nakedness around. He came to meet me, and invited
me to share his repast. For the last three years the poor
missionary has been suffering from a dysentery, which has
become chronic. However, he complains neither of his
bad health nor of his poverty: the only thing that grieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
him was the small number of converts he was called on to
baptize, so deeply are the Cambodians attached to their
idols.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANTICIPATED PERILS.</div>

<p>“But you,” said he to me; “do you know whither you
are going? I am astonished that they allowed you to
leave Pinhalú. Ask the Cambodians what they think of
the forests of the Stiêns, and propose to some of them to
accompany you: you would not find one. The rains have
begun, and you are going to almost certain death, or will
at least catch a fever, which will be followed by years of
languor and suffering. I have had the jungle fever, and it
is something terrible: even to the tips of my nails I felt
a heat which I can only call infernal: sometimes an icy
coldness would take its place: generally people sink under
it: witness M. Lafitte, a young missionary, who a short
time ago took the same journey; M. Comte, who died of
exhaustion; and many others.”</p>

<p>This account was not reassuring, nevertheless I had
determined on my route: I knew that I should find
there land and fresh-water shells which I could find nowhere
else,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and that this tribe of almost unknown
savages would afford me a curious and interesting study;
and these considerations were sufficient to determine me
to proceed. I trusted in God, and went on my way,
M. Cordier’s last words being, “May God be with the
poor traveller!”</p>

<p class="caption">CAMBODIAN HUT AT PEMPTIELAN, ON THE MEKON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Twelve miles higher up I left the river, and set off on
my land journey at two o’clock in the afternoon, hoping
to arrive the same day at Pemptiélan, a large village,
where lived the mandarin to whom the king’s letter was
addressed. We did not, however, get there till eleven
the next morning, having to pass the night at the foot of
a tree, where we lighted a fire. I waited at once upon
the mandarin, who is governor of the district, and he
received me very well, in spite of the small value of the
presents I made him, and immediately gave orders for
waggons to be made ready for me. He then presented
me with a quantity of tobacco and betel. His manners
were, for a Cambodian, gentle and polished; and he
questioned me much as to the war in Cochin-China, as
well as about Europe, how long it took to get there, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFICULTIES OF THE JOURNEY.</div>

<p>From the time we left Pemptiélan we had, except at
rare intervals, to pass through dense forests, and at first
the ground was so marshy that our miserable waggons
occasionally sank deeply; and it required the united
strength of the oxen and all our men to extricate them.
We got over the latter part of our route more agreeably;
for, as we reached a higher elevation, the ground became
dry, and the aspect of the country more varied.</p>

<p>We had only been able to accomplish 60 miles in five
days, and were still 30 miles from Brelum. I grew tired
of the incivility of the inhabitants from whom I hired the
oxen, and of the slowness of these animals: when we had
no shelter for the night, we suffered much from rain and
damp; our clothes were almost always soaked through;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and, to crown our misfortunes, my two servants were
attacked with intermittent fever; the Annamite particularly,
who had a tertian fever, lasting for ten days.</p>

<p>The mode of life of the Cambodians is similar to that
of the Siamese: rice, as with the latter, is the chief part
of their food: they eat it with vegetables, such as pumpkins
or gourds, and wild potatoes. Those in better circumstances
add to it fish, but rarely meat; and yet the
country is as fertile as Lower Cochin-China, the soil of
which yields so abundant a return for all that is put in
the ground.</p>

<p>The poverty of the inhabitants of these miserable
villages engenders a repulsive dirtiness: a strip of matting
or an old filthy cushion thrown on the ground, and
full of vermin, some basins of coarse Chinese porcelain,
a sort of hatchet, and a piece of cotton, intended either
for counterpane, scarf, or cloak, according to the season

<div class="sidenote">PUMP-KA-DAYE.</div>

<p>We arrived at Pump-Ka-Daye, on the confines of Cambodia,
and inhabited by about twenty Stiêns, who have
approached the boundary in order to escape slavery in
their own tribe. Our waggons halted before a small caravanserai,
open to every wind; and after having carried in
our luggage, our guides disappeared much faster than
they had come. The chief soon presented himself, followed
by some men: he had all the characteristics of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
savage in his face, and of a Cambodian in his nature. I
handed him my letter, but he returned it, saying that he
could not read. “These, then,” said I, “are the contents.
It is the king’s order to all chiefs of villages where I
shall stop to furnish me with waggons to continue my
journey to Brelum.” “We have no waggons,” was the
answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ASSISTANCE FROM M. GUILLOUX.</div>

<p>We made ourselves as comfortable as we could till the
next day, when a second interview with the chief proved
to me that I should get no aid from him. I therefore
sent Niou with two Cambodians to carry a letter to
M. Guilloux, and bring me an answer. This arrived on
the evening of the fourth day; and in it M. Guilloux
assured me of a cordial welcome, adding that he was
interested in my undertaking, and had already a great
regard for me, without seeing me, for my courage in
coming so far.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The good father sent me three waggons
from the mission settlement, and some of his Annamites,
as well as two Stiêns, to help me on my way. This letter
completely removed all fear of being a troublesome and
unwelcome guest to the poor hermit, and I set out
with pleasure and confidence. It took us two long days’
journey to reach Brelum: we encamped one night near
a torrent, lying on our mats beside a good fire, which we
lighted to keep off the ferocious denizens of these forests.
The second night we passed in a deserted cabin some
miles from Brelum; and on the 16th August, at nine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the morning, we came to a clearing of from 250 to 300
metres square. We were betwixt two hills, at the foot of
which was marshy ground. On the slope of one I saw
two long bamboo houses, covered with thatch, and with
the mission-garden attached: higher up was the cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
planted two years before amidst these frightful solitudes
by the noble and courageous French missionaries.</p>

<div>Scarcely had we appeared when we were saluted by a
discharge of musketry. We replied as well as we could;
and while these sounds were reverberating among the
echoes of the forests, poor Father Guilloux, his legs
covered with bad wounds, which had confined him for
above six months to his mattrass, and which he had
received on the journeys undertaken through the promptings
of his pious zeal, advanced with frail steps to meet
me along the tree-trunks thrown as a bridge across the

<div class="sidenote">THE SAVAGE STIENS.</div>

<p>I resided nearly three months among the savage Stiêns.
Is this too short a period to enable me to form an
opinion of them? One would think so, on hearing
Father Guilloux repeat often that, although he has lived
here two years, he is yet far from knowing all their superstitions
and <i>devilries</i>.</p>

<p>We are surrounded by forests, which are infested with
elephants, buffaloes, rhinoceros, tigers, and wild boars, and
the ground all about the pools is covered with their footprints.
We live almost as in a besieged place, every
moment dreading some attack of the enemy, and keeping
our guns constantly loaded. Sometimes they come close
to our quarters, and we cannot go even a few steps into
the woods without hearing them. As a general rule,
however, they fly from the approach of man, and in order
to get a shot it is necessary to lie in wait either amongst
the branches of a tree or hidden amid the brushwood
near the spots where they come to drink.</p>

<p>Scorpions, centipedes, and, above all, serpents, were the
enemies we most dreaded, and against which precautions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
were chiefly requisite; but the mosquitoes and the
leeches, though less dangerous, were the most troublesome
and most inveterate plagues. During the rainy
season you cannot be too much on your guard; going
to bed or getting up, you are ever in peril of putting
hand or foot on some venomous snake. I have killed
more than one in my house with a gun or a hatchet. As
I write, I am obliged to be continually on the watch,
fearing to see one reappear on which I trod this evening,
but which made his exit without hurting me. From
time to time, also, I stop to listen to the roaring of a
tiger, who is wandering round our dwelling and looking
longingly at the pigs through their fence of planks and
bamboos. Again, I hear a rhinoceros breaking down the
bamboos which oppose his progress towards the brambles
encircling our garden, on which he intends to banquet.</p>

<p>The savage Stiêns who inhabit this region have probably
the same origin as those who people the mountains
and the table-land which separate the kingdoms of Siam
and Cambodia from that of Annam, and which extend
along the great river from 11° north lat. and between
106° and 108° east long. They form as many separate
communities as there are villages, and seem to be a race
distinct from all the people who surround them. I am
myself inclined to believe them to be the aborigines of
the country, and to suppose that they have been driven
back from the sea and the rivers to the districts now
occupied by them by the successive invasions of the Thibetans,
who have spread themselves over Laos, Siam, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Cambodia, and nothing that I can discover leads to any
other supposition.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>These savages are so strongly attached to their forests
and mountains that to quit them seems almost like death,
and those who are dragged as slaves to the neighbouring
countries languish under captivity and try every method
of escape, frequently with success. Like other savages,
they have appeared formidable to their neighbours, and
the fear inspired by them has occasioned exaggerated
reports of their wonderful skill in shooting with the bow,
as well as of the pestilential climate. However, it is a
fact that fever prevails here terribly; numbers of Annamites
and Cambodians have fallen victims to it, and
I am assured that I am the only stranger who has come
without suffering from it more or less. These people love
the deep shade of the pathless woods, which they do
not trouble themselves to cut down; but if they cling to
their country, they do not to any particular locality, for
if they meet with any inconvenience in their neighbourhood,
or if any of their family die of fever, they raise
their camp, take their children in baskets on their backs,
and set off to make a settlement elsewhere; land is not
wanting, and the forest everywhere alike.</p>

<p>These tribes are nearly independent, although the Cambodians
on one side, and the Laotians and Annamites on
the other, levy on the villages near them a triennial tribute
of rice and wax. The King of Cambodia does not want
the will to treat the Stiêns as he did the Thiâmes, in order
to people some of his desert provinces.</p>

<p>The inscription placed&mdash;alas! so vainly&mdash;on our public
edifices is here, notwithstanding slavery, the motto of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
people, and its sincerity is evidenced in their practice.
We use words; they act. If there is abundance at one
house, the whole village shares in it, and when scarcity
prevails, which is often the case, all alike suffer.</p>

<p>They work admirably in iron and ivory, and some tribes
are noted, as in Annam, for their hatchets and the
beautiful workmanship of their sabres. Their drinking-vessels
are rude, but of their own manufacture, and the
women weave and dye the long fine scarfs which they
wear, the best of which are often valued at the price of an
ox. They cultivate rice, maize, tobacco, various kinds of
vegetables, and fruit-trees, such as bananas, mangoes, and
oranges. Every person of any substance possesses several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
slaves, and a field, always at some distance from the
village, and very carefully attended to. In these fields, in
little huts raised on piles, the Stiêns pass the whole of
the rainy season, during which they can neither hunt
nor fish, both on account of the inclement weather and
the leeches, the immense numbers of which, as in the
forests of Siam, make them a perfect pest.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">SAVAGE STIENS SOWING THEIR RICE.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">RICE CULTIVATION.</div>

<div>Their manner of preparing a rice-field is very different
from the way in which our agriculturists set about
matters. As soon as the first rains begin to fall, the
Stiên chooses his ground, and busies himself in clearing
it. This would be a laborious task for a European; but
he, with his hatchet with cane handle, has in a few days
cut down a thicket of bamboos 100 or 150 mètres square.
If he meets with any tree too large for him to manage,
he leaves it standing. After a few days, when the canes
are a little dry, he sets fire to them, and the field is
soon cleared. As for the roots, he cares little about
them, as no digging is required; on this virgin soil everything
grows with little labour. There only remains to sow
the seed, and for this purpose he takes two long bamboos,
which he lays in a line on the ground; then, with a
stick in each hand, he makes on each side of this line
holes about an inch or an inch and a half deep at short
distances. The man’s work is now finished, and that of
the woman begins: stooping down, she follows the line
traced by her husband, and from a basket carried at her
left side takes a handful of rice, of which she throws a
few grains into each hole with great rapidity, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
same time so dexterously that it is rare for any to fall
outside. In a few hours the task is finished, for here there
is no need of harrow or plough; kind Nature will soon
send some violent showers, which, washing the soil over
the holes, will cover the seeds. Then the proprietor
establishes himself in his hut, where, as he smokes his
cigarette (made of tobacco rolled in some leaf), he lets fly
his arrows at the wild boars, apes, or goats, or amuses
himself by frightening away the doves and parroquets. To
this end, a couple of bamboos are so placed in the middle
of the field that, by pulling a rope made of rattan, they
are made to strike against each other, and the noise scares
away the birds, which without some such contrivance
would eat up all the seed. The harvest is reaped at the
end of October. Generally, two months previously poverty
and famine begin to make themselves felt.
<div class="sidenote">IMPROVIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE.</div>
As long as
provisions last they feast without ever thinking of the
morrow; when they are exhausted they are reduced to
eat serpents, toads, and bats, which last are found in great
numbers in the hollows of the old bamboos. Often they
have even to content themselves with the seeds of the
maize, young bamboo-shoots, wild roots, and other spontaneous
productions of the ground.</div>

<p>All the domestic animals of the neighbouring countries,
such as oxen, pigs, fowls, and ducks, are found here, but
in small numbers. Elephants are scarce; but farther
north, among the tribe of the Benams, it is said that no
village is without them.</p>

<p>When the harvest has been gathered in the Stiêns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
commence a series of festivities. The rice having been
piled up in oblong stacks, they take from these every
morning as much as suffices for the day’s consumption.
One community sends invitations to another, and the
inhabitants of a wealthy village will often kill as many as
ten oxen for the entertainment; all must be consumed
before they separate, and day and night they eat and
drink to the accompaniment of the Chinese tam-tam and
tambourine. This excess, after a long period of privation,
brings on illness, commonly the itch and other cutaneous
disorders. Much of this, however, also proceeds from the
want of salt, which they cannot always procure. For
all internal complaints, the general remedy here, as in
Cambodia, is an iron heated in the fire and applied to the
pit of the stomach, and there are few men without scars
on this part of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.</div>

<p>They are acquainted with many of the remedies drawn
from simples; they never cover up a wound or sore, but
leave it exposed to the air and sun, and it generally heals.
They appear to be exempt from leprosy, so common
among the Chinese; but then they are very cleanly, and
bathe in all weathers, often three times a day.</p>

<p>The Stiêns have no resemblance to either the Cambodian
or Annamite races; like the last, however, they
wear the hair long, twisted up, and fastened by a bamboo
comb, in which is often inserted, for ornament, a piece of
brass wire surmounted by the crest of a pheasant. They
are usually above the middle height, are well proportioned
and robust; their features are regular, and the thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
eyebrows and beard of the men, when they do not pull
out the hair from the face, give them a grave appearance.
The forehead is well developed, and announces an intelligence
much beyond that of the Annamites. Their manners
are hospitable, and a stranger is always certain of being
well received and feasted. They either kill a pig or fowl,
and offer you wine, which is not drunk out of any sort of
vessel, but sucked, through a bamboo cane, from a large
jar; it is made from rice, fermented, but rarely distilled.
To refuse a pipe when offered is considered a great rudeness,
which more than one savage has paid for by a
knife-thrust. It is also etiquette to eat the whole of the
food set before you.</p>

<p>Their only dress is the long scarf I have already
mentioned, and which, when worn, appears only about
two inches wide. I often surprised them quite naked in
their cabins; but on perceiving me they always covered
themselves.</p>

<p>The greatest liberty is allowed to slaves, and corporal
punishment is never inflicted on any one. For theft, a
forfeit is exacted of a pig or ox, and several jars of wine,
of which the whole village partake. If the fine be not
paid, it rapidly increases in amount; the offender is soon
in debt to the community for fifteen or twenty buffaloes,
and finally he is sold as a slave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUPERSTITIONS.</div>

<p>The Stiêns have neither priests nor temples, yet they
recognise the existence of a supreme being, to whom they
refer everything good or evil; they call him “Brâ,” and
invoke him in all cases. They believe also in an evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
genius, and attribute all diseases to him. If any one be
suffering from illness, they say it is the demon tormenting
him; and, with this idea, make, night and day, an insupportable
noise around the patient, which they keep up until
one of the party falls in a kind of fit, crying out, “He has
passed into my body; he is stifling me.” They then
question the new patient, asking him, first, what remedies
to give the sick man, and how the demon can be made to
abandon his prey. Sometimes the sacrifice of a pig or an
ox is required, often a human victim; in this latter case
they pitilessly seize upon a slave and offer him up to the
evil genius.</p>

<p>Funerals are solemnly performed, the whole village
assisting, with the exception of the nearest relatives, who
generally remain at home. All those present fill the air
with lamentable cries. They bury their dead near their
dwellings, covering the tomb with a little roof of branches,
beneath which they place gourds full of water, and sometimes
small bows and arrows; and every day some
member of the family comes and sows a few grains of rice,
that the dead may have something to eat. These customs
resemble those of the Chinese.</p>

<p>Before every meal they take care to spill a little rice
to feed the souls of their ancestors, and in their fields and
other places formerly frequented by them they make
similar little offerings to them. At the end of a long
bamboo planted in the ground they suspend plumes of
reeds; lower down are fastened smaller bamboos containing
a few drops of wine or water; and, lastly, on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
slight trellis-work raised above the ground, is laid some
earth, in which they stick an arrow, and on which they
throw a few grains of cooked rice, a bone, a little tobacco,
and a leaf.</p>

<p>According to their belief, animals also have souls which
wander about after their death; thus, when they have
killed one, fearing lest its soul should come and torment
them, they ask pardon for the evil they have done to it,
and offer sacrifices proportioned to the strength and size of
the animal. For an elephant, the ceremony is conducted
with pomp; the head is ornamented with crowns, and
musical performances on the tam-tam and tambourine,
with singing, are continued for seven consecutive days.
The whole village, summoned by sound of trumpet,
assembles to take part in the fête, and every one is
entitled to a portion of the flesh.</p>

<p>The Stiêns smoke the flesh of the animals when they
desire to preserve it for any length of time; but ordinarily,
all those taken in the chase are eaten on the spot,
and within a few days; they then merely singe them
whole, without skinning, and afterwards cut them in
pieces and cook them.</p>

<p>It is rare to meet a Stiên without his cross-bow in his
hand, his knife over his shoulder, and a basket on his
back, which serves both for quiver and game-bag. Hunting
and fishing occupy all the time not given to the cultivation
of the ground. They are indefatigable in the
chase, and glide amidst the thickest woods with the speed
of a deer, seeming not to feel fatigue. The women appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
as robust and strong as the men. Their cross-bows are
very effective weapons, and they are skilful in the use
of them; but rarely shoot from a distance of more than
fifty paces. They use poisoned arrows for the larger
animals, the venom being extremely rapid in its effects;
if the beast, whether it be elephant, tiger, or rhinoceros,
have the skin ever so slightly pierced, so that the poison
touches the blood, it is almost certain to be found dead a
few hundred yards from the place where it was struck.</p>

<p>They are very fond of ornaments, particularly beads of
brilliant colours, which they make into bracelets. Glass
ornaments and brass wire pass among them as money;
a buffalo or an ox is valued at six armfulls of thick brass
wire; a pig is nearly as dear; but for a small piece of fine
wire or a bead necklace you can purchase a pheasant or
a hundred ears of maize. Men generally wear a bracelet
above the elbow and one at the wrist; but the women
cover both arms and legs with these ornaments. Both
sexes have their ears pierced, and widen the hole every
year by inserting pieces of bone or ivory three inches
long.</p>

<p>Polygamy is held in honour among the Stiêns, although
only the chiefs are rich enough to allow themselves the
luxury of several wives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.</div>

<p>While I was among them there was a total eclipse of
the sun, which, if I remember right, was also visible in
England. Like the Cambodians, on the occurrence of such
phenomena, they believe that some being has swallowed
up the sun and moon; and in order to deliver them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
made a frightful noise, beat the tam-tam, uttered savage
cries, and shot arrows into the air, until the sun reappeared.</p>

<p>One of their favourite amusements is to send up kites,
to which they attach a musical instrument somewhat
resembling a bow, and this, when agitated by the wind,
produces sweet and melodious sounds to which they are
fond of listening.</p>

<p>Their memories are bad, and they have great difficulty
in learning to calculate. If a hundred ears of maize are
to be offered for sale, they are arranged in tens, to make
sure that the number is correct. Their notions of geography
are very limited; they imagine that white men
inhabit only a few obscure corners of the globe, and,
judging of them by the Catholic missionaries, doubt much
if they have any women among them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODE OF WARFARE.</div>

<p>Hostilities between one village and another are not
infrequent, but they are never very serious: they seek to
surprise and take one another prisoners in the fields or
pathways, and the captives are sold as slaves to the
Laotians or Cambodians. Their disposition is gentle and
timid, and at the least alarm of an enemy they retire into
the forest, previously placing in the paths sharp-pointed
stakes of bamboo, which often pierce quite through the
feet of their pursuers.</p>

<p>The manners of the savages of Brelum and those of
the surrounding villages differ considerably; this is owing
to the influence of the good and courageous missionaries,
who, although they do not make many converts&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
is their chief trouble&mdash;have at least the consolation of
being able by their presence, good counsel, and example,
to soften and enlighten these poor creatures&mdash;in one word,
to civilize them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FAUNA.</div>

<p>The Fauna of this country does not differ much from
that of the kingdom of Siam; thus, with the exception
of some beautiful new species of insects and land shells,
and a number of interesting birds, I shall gain by my
excursion nothing but the pleasure of having been able
to study the habits of a curious people, and the not inferior
gratification of making them known to the public, should
these rough notes, written hastily, and with no claim to
any merit but truth, be destined to see the light. Whether
God reserves for me the happiness of again seeing my
native country, in which event it will be my endeavour
to put them into some sort of readable shape; or whether
I fall a victim to pestilence or ferocious beasts, and some
kind person takes charge of these sheets, scribbled
generally by the light of a torch, and on my knees at the
foot of a tree, amidst interruptions of all sorts, of which
the mosquitoes are not the least annoying; in either case,
living or dead, I shall need, I am aware, an indulgence
seldom granted. Most readers prefer being amused to
being instructed; while my sole aim has been to paint
faithfully, and to the best of my poor abilities, what came
under my observation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRIVATIONS OF MISSIONARIES.</div>

<p>My arrival here was&mdash;I may say it without vanity,
for I was a stranger to him&mdash;quite an event in the poor
missionary’s lonely life; and the landing&mdash;for it did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
deserve the name of room&mdash;left vacant by the departure
of Father Arnoux, was placed at my disposal. I ask
pardon of the good, brave, and generous priests who have
aided, welcomed, and sheltered me through all my
wanderings, if I have spoken too plainly of their poverty
and privations of all kinds; if I have raised the curtain
which, perhaps, they would wish to keep drawn, for, I
repeat, they look not for recompense in this world; but
I have done it that the world may know that their life is
one of the hardest and most painful, and requires self-sacrifice
more than any other. Exposed to the influence
of pernicious climates, badly lodged, badly fed, far from
their families and from their country, often ill and dying
without help&mdash;such is the lot of these men.</p>

<p>The house of uncle Apait was at least as elegant and
well furnished as that of the humble priest at Brelum:
both had the bare ground for a floor, walls of bamboo
canes, and dried grass for thatch. The hut was divided
into four compartments, two being used by the missionaries,
another by their servant, and the fourth served as a
chapel. This, like the others, was far from splendid, and
the whole house had been so undermined by the white
ants, that it seemed menaced with approaching ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ANNAMITES.</div>

<p>Speaking of the Annamite servants, I shall quote what
the Abbé Gagelin says about them, for I can testify to its
truth. “All sensibility,” says he, “appears deadened
among them; they are very proud, however, and great
cheats. There is so little affection among them, that the
nearest relations never think of embracing; even a child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
returning to his parents after a ten years’ absence, would
not think of such a thing. Among brothers and sisters
it would be considered almost a scandal. They will not
permit us missionaries to caress a child, not even a baby.
This coldness is not confined to their domestic relations;
under an ardent sky, which should warm the imagination,
they, in their stupid <i>sang froid</i>, will not tolerate in a
preacher the slightest movement or gesture.” However,
to compensate for these defects, the abbé, who, even in
the opinion of several of the other missionaries, has been
guilty of great errors in his letters, might have added that,
at times, they are capable of acts of devotion and self-sacrifice
truly great and courageous.</p>

<p>The French missionaries in Cochin China must have
had many proofs of this, for, hunted as they are like wild
beasts, they could not long escape the vigilant eyes of the
mandarins, nor continue, in spite of the most terrible
persecutions, to reside in the country. It is death for
any one to be caught sheltering or assisting a priest;
but, notwithstanding, they and their goods are conveyed
in boats from Singapore, eluding all the spies set to watch
for them, and remain hidden for months and even years.
If an alarm is raised, in spite of the danger of discovery,
they are conveyed to another locality, where they find
new friends equally ready to peril their lives for them.
Missions are founded amongst the most savage tribes;
and in spite of the terrible reputation of this climate, in
spite of fevers, wild beasts, and love of home, the missionary
has but to speak, and he is sure to find poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Christians ready to follow him, often without fee or
reward. In what country in the world, among what
civilized people of the West, can you find more than
this?</p>

<p>Intelligent, and with a desire for civilization, the only
difficulty is to know how to guide them. From my own
experience and that of others, I believe the Annamite to
be lively, adroit, intelligent, and courageous; but obstinate,
vindictive, a dissembler, a liar, and a thief; slow
to get into a passion, but terrible when he does so. His
dirtiness surpasses anything I have ever seen, and his
food is abominably nasty. Rotten fish and dog’s flesh are
his favourite diet.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">TIGER HUNTING.</div>

<p>The tiger of Annam is terribly savage, and his strength
is equal to his ferocity. Often, however, a couple of men
will go alone to attack one, armed merely with pikes. As
soon as they see the animal, the more powerful or more
courageous of the two lowers his pike; the tiger hesitates
a moment, and sometimes, if not pressed by hunger, turns
and disappears with the rapidity of lightning; but at
other times he will make a spring at the hunter, when,
if the force of the leap do not carry him right over the
man’s head, he falls upon the pike, which the hunter then
elevates by pressing the handle on the ground. The
second hunter now comes forward, and in his turn pierces
him, and uniting their strength, they both hold him down
till he dies. Occasionally the first man misses his aim,
and his pike breaks; then all is over for one, if not both.
The most common method of hunting the tiger has more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
actors engaged. There is in every village some experienced
man who leads the attack; and if any one has
been carried off by one of these animals, the tam-tam is
sounded to summon people from the neighbouring villages
to follow this leader after the creature. As he always
sleeps near the spot where he has left the remains of
his repast, they are pretty sure of discovering his retreat.</p>

<p>When they have tracked the tiger to his lair, all the
hunters form a circle as large as their number will allow,
and sufficiently apart not to impede each other’s movements.
These preparations completed, the leader makes
sure that the animal has no outlet for escape. Some of
the most daring then venture into the centre and cut
away the brushwood, during which operation they are
protected by others armed with pikes. The tiger, pressed
on all sides, rolls his eyes, licks his paws in a convulsive
manner, as though preparing for combat, then, with a
frightful howl, he makes his spring. Immediately every
pike is raised, and the animal falls pierced through and
through. Accidents not infrequently happen, and many
are often severely hurt; but they have no choice but to
wage war against the tigers, which leave them no rest,
force the enclosures, and carry off domestic animals and
even men, not only from the roads and close vicinity of
the houses, but from the interiors of the buildings. In
Annam, the fear inspired by the tigers, elephants, and
other wild animals, makes the people address them with
the greatest respect; they give them the title of “Grandfather”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
or “Lord,” fearing that they may be offended, and
show resentment by attacking them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLIMATE.</div>

<p>During the three months I passed in Brelum and
its environs, my two poor servants were almost constantly
ill with fever. I think myself very fortunate to have preserved
my health, for even in these forests I have not had
a touch of this complaint. In the rainy season the atmosphere
is dreadfully damp and oppressive; in the thickest
wood, where the sun scarcely penetrates, you might fancy
yourself in a stove, and with the slightest exercise you are
in a bath of perspiration.</p>

<p>In July and August we experienced violent storms, which
burst out every second or third day; but in September
and October it rained without intermission. At the
beginning of November, after a change of wind, we had
some refreshing nights, which made the thermometer fall
to 12° centigrade. From noon to three o’clock there was
little variation in the temperature.</p>

<p>Having paid visits to all the villages in the neighbourhood,
and been visited in return by many of the inhabitants,
I announced to my two excellent friends the
missionaries that I must shortly leave them, and fixed my
departure for the 29th November, meaning to return to
Pinhalú and Udong, and from thence to ascend the
Mekon as far as the great lake Touli-Sap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Return to Pinhalu and Udong&mdash;The Great Lake Touli-Sap&mdash;Meeting
with Nine Elephants&mdash;Recent Acts of Oppression
towards the People&mdash;On the eventual Regeneration
of the People&mdash;The Province of Battambong&mdash;Grand
Ruins.</span></p></div>


<p>On the 29th I took leave of my amiable fellow-countryman
and friend, M. Arnoux, to, I may venture to affirm,
our mutual regret, and set off, accompanied by Father
Guilloux, who had some business at Pinhalú. They both
wished me to remain with them until Cochin China was
open, and I could travel through the country in safety:
I should have liked to do so, could I have foreseen an
approaching termination of the war; but in the then state
of affairs that was impossible.</p>

<p>As far as Pump-Ka-Daye, the first village we came to
after leaving Brelum, I had the society and aid of the missionaries,
and of the old chief of the Stiêns, who furnished
me with three waggons for my baggage, while Phrai and
M. Guilloux’s Annamite attendants took charge of my
boxes of insects, which, if placed among my other goods,
would have been injured by the jolting.</p>

<p>The rains had ceased for the last three weeks, and I
was agreeably surprised at the improvement in the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of the country since August. The paths were dry, and
we had no longer to flounder through dirty marshes, nor
suffer from the wet nights which we formerly found so
unpleasant. When we reached the station where we
were to pass the first night, our servants lighted a fire to
cook their rice, as well as scare away the wild beasts;
but, notwithstanding this, we remarked that our oxen,
dogs, and monkey showed signs of great fear, and, almost
immediately afterwards, we heard a roaring like that of a
lion. We seized our guns, which were loaded, and waited
in readiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HERD OF ELEPHANTS.</div>

<p>Fresh roarings, proceeding from a very short distance
off, completed the terror of our animals; and we ourselves
could not help feeling uneasy. I proposed to go and
meet the enemy, which was agreed to, and we accordingly
plunged into that part of the forest whence the sound
came. Although familiar with these terrible creatures, we
felt far from comfortable; but before long we came upon
recent tracks which were quite unmistakeable, and soon,
in a small clearing in the forest, perceived nine elephants,
the leader being a male of enormous size, standing right
in front of us.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</p>

<p class="caption">HALT OF THE CARAVAN IN THE JUNGLE BETWEEN BATTAMBONG AND BANGKOK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On our approach he set up a roar more frightful than
ever, and the whole herd advanced slowly towards us.
We remained in a stooping position, half hidden behind
the trees, which were too tall for us to climb. I was in
the act of taking aim at the forehead of the leader, the
only vulnerable part, but an Annamite who stood beside
me, and who was an old hunter, knocked up my rifle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and begged me not to fire; “for,” said he, “if you kill
or wound one of the elephants we are lost; and even if we
should succeed in escaping, the oxen, the waggons, and all
their contents would be overwhelmed by the fury of these
animals. If there were but two or three, we might hope
to kill them; but nine, of whom five are very large, are
too many; and it will be more prudent to retreat.” At
this moment, Father Guilloux, who had not much confidence
in his powers of locomotion, fired his gun in the air
to frighten the elephants; and this plan fortunately succeeded:
the herd stopped in astonishment for an instant,
then turned round, and marched into the forest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCHANGE OF PRESENTS.</div>

<p>When we reached Pemptiélan we stopped at the house
of the mandarin, whose authority extends over the neighbouring
district, and, contrary to the usual custom, he
offered us hospitality under his own roof. Scarcely, however,
were we installed when he came to me and asked
for the best of my guns, and, on my declining to part
with it, he begged for something else, intimating that
we should have begun by offering a present. Thereupon
I gave him a suit of European clothes, a powder-flask and
some powder, a hunting-knife, and some other small articles.
In return he presented me with an ivory trumpet, and
placed at my service two elephants to enable me to continue
my route more comfortably: he likewise sent off
our people with a letter to the chiefs of the Srokkhner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECENT ACTS OF OPPRESSION.</div>

<p>We resumed our journey on the following day, the
Abbé on one elephant, reading his breviary, and I upon
another, both of us greatly enjoying the beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
landscape. Thus we traversed the beautiful plains, which,
when I formerly travelled this road, were inhabited by
the poor Thiâmes; but now, in place of rich harvest, I
was astonished to find nothing but large trees: the villages
were abandoned, and the houses and enclosures in ruins.
It appeared that the mandarin of Pemptiélan, executing
or exceeding the orders of his master the king of Cambodia,
had kept these unfortunate people in such a state
of slavery and oppression that they had even been
deprived of their fishing and agricultural implements,
and, being left without money or resources, experienced
such frightful poverty that many of them died of hunger.</p>

<p>The poor wretches, to the number of several thousands,
and under the conduct of a chief on whose head a price
had been set, and who had secretly returned from Annam,
rose in revolt. Those from Penom-Peuh went to Udong
to protect their brethren in that place in their flight; and
when all were united in one body, they descended the
river, and passed into Cochin China. Orders were issued
by the king to arrest their departure, but no one remained
to execute them; for the whole Cambodian population,
with the mandarins at their head, had fled into
the forests at the first news of the rising.</p>

<p>Besides the interest inspired by the misfortunes of
these poor people, their conduct, when all fled before
them, and left Udong, Pinhalú, and Penom-Peuh defenceless,
was so noble as greatly to increase this feeling.
“We have no enmity against the people,” said they, “if
they will but let us pass and respect our property; but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
will put to death whoever opposes our flight.” And, in
fact, they never touched one of the large boats which
were moored near the market, and unguarded, but took
to the river in their narrow and miserable pirogues.</p>

<p>In passing opposite the island of Ko-Sutin we stopped
to see Father Cordier. The good missionary was in a sad
state: his malady had got worse; and his debility was
such that he could scarcely drag himself from his bed to
a chair. He had no food but rice and dried fish; and the
only persons to care for him, and wait upon him, were
two children of ten years old. We begged him to accompany
us to Pinhalú, but he declined, on account of
his weakness. “All I regret,” said he, “is, that I shall
see my poor parents no more; but for that, I should await
death calmly, and almost with joy.” All our solicitations
that he would go with us were unavailing; and we were
forced to pursue our journey, very sad at leaving him in
so painful a position, and at our inability to give him any
relief.</p>

<p>On the 21st December we at last reached Pinhalú.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PENOM-PEUH.</div>

<p>Penom-Peuh is about 103° 3′ 50″ long. of Paris, and
11° 37′ 30″ north lat. It is the great market of Cambodia,
and only two or three leagues from the southern
frontier of Cochin China: it is situated at the confluence
of the Mekon with its tributary: from this point the river
flows first north-east, and then north-west, as far as China
and the mountains of Thibet. The arm, which has no
name, but which, to distinguish it, it might be well to call
Mé-Sap, from the name of the lake Touli-Sap, flows from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
its source south-east to the point of junction. About
12° 25′ north lat. commences the great lake, which
stretches as far as 13° 53′. In shape it might be compared
to a violin. The whole space between it and the
Mekon is a vast plain; while on the opposite side are the
great chains of Poursat and its ramifications.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAKE OF CAMBODIA.</div>

<p>The entrance to the great lake of Cambodia is grand
and beautiful. The river becomes wider and wider, until
at last it is four or five miles in breadth; and then you
enter the immense sheet of water called Touli-Sap, as
large and full of motion as a sea. It is more than 120
miles long, and must be at least 400 in circumference.</p>

<p>The shore is low, and thickly covered with trees, which
are half submerged; and in the distance is visible an
extensive range of mountains whose highest peaks seem
lost in the clouds. The waves glitter in the broad sunshine
with a brilliancy which the eye can scarcely support,
and, in many parts of the lake, nothing is visible all
around but water. In the centre is planted a tall mast,
indicating the boundary between the kingdoms of Siam
and Cambodia. Before crossing the lake it may, perhaps,
be as well to say what remains to be told respecting the
latter country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRESENT STATE OF CAMBODIA.</div>

<p>The present state of Cambodia is deplorable, and its
future menacing.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Formerly, however, it was a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and populous country, as is testified by the splendid ruins
which are to be met with in the provinces of Battambong
and Ongcor, and which I intend visiting; but at
present the population is excessively reduced by the incessant
wars carried on against neighbouring states. I do
not think that the country now contains above a million
of inhabitants, and, according to the last census, the
number of free men fit to carry arms is returned at 30,000,
the slaves, as in Siam, not being liable to serve in the
army any more than to pay taxes. Besides a number of
Chinese, relatively great, there are many Malays, who
have been settled in the country for centuries, and a
floating population of Annamites, amounting to two or
three thousand. As the calculations taken include only
the males fit for active service, no exact figures can be
furnished by the authorities.</p>

<p>European conquest, abolition of slavery, wise and protecting
laws, and experience, fidelity, and scrupulous
rectitude in those who administer them, would alone effect
the regeneration of this state. It lies near to Cochin
China, the subjection of which France is now aiming at,
and in which she will doubtless succeed: under her sway
it will become a land of plenty. I wish her to possess
this land, which would add a magnificent jewel to her
crown; but it is also my earnest desire that she may
make a judicious choice of governors, and that the name of
France, my dear and beautiful country, may be loved,
respected, and honoured in the extreme East, as it should
be everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PRODUCTIONS.</div>

<p>The chief productions of Cambodia are tobacco, pepper,
ginger, sugar, gamboge, coffee, silk, and cotton. The
latter important article of commerce thrives here admirably;
and as, according to report, America is menaced
with civil war, it is a question whether we can henceforth
calculate on that country for the supply it has hitherto
furnished. If that supply were even partially to fail, and
thousands of workmen to be in consequence thrown out
of employment, what a vast field might be opened on
the banks of the Mekon and of Touli-Sap for European
activity, industry, and capital!</p>

<p>England, that great nation for colonies, could soon make
of Lower Cochin China and Cambodia a vast cotton plantation;
and there is no doubt that, if she set about it in
earnest, with her Australian, East and West Indian, and
New Zealand possessions, she might soon secure to herself
the monopoly, which America now has, of this precious
article: we should in that case be compelled to buy from
her. Why should we not be our own purveyors? The
island of Ko-Sutin alone, in which the lands belonging to
the crown are let to the cotton-planters in lots for one
pound per lot, may be adduced in order to give an idea
of the profits realized by the cultivation of this plant.
Each lot affords an income of more than 1200 francs.</p>

<p>The forests situated on the higher grounds abound with
justly-celebrated timber, as also trees yielding resins and
gums much esteemed in commerce, likewise the eagle-wood
and several species of dye-woods.</p>

<p>The mountains contain gold, argentiferous lead, zinc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
copper, and iron, the last two in some abundance. One
is astonished to find these fertile lands furnish so little for
exportation; but the sovereigns and mandarins enrich
themselves by spoliation and extortion, and every abuse
which can ruin a country and retard its progress. If
these dominions were ruled wisely and carefully, with
probity, and with a regard to the interests of the working
classes, the whole aspect of affairs would be changed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAXES.</div>

<p>The taxes now weigh solely on the cultivator and producer:
the more he raises, the more he has to pay: disposed,
therefore, to indolence by the influence of the
climate, he has little inducement to combat this vice.
The beautiful cardamom of Poursat, much sought after by
the Chinese, who pay very highly for it, is entirely monopolized
by the king and his ministers; and it is nearly
the same with every valuable product.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Description of the Temple of Ongcor&mdash;Observations on these
Ruins, and on others in the Provinces of Ongcor and Battambong.</span></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preliminary Remarks.</span></h3>

<p>Nokhor, or Ongcor, was the capital of the ancient kingdom
of Cambodia, or Khmer, formerly so famous among the
great states of Indo-China, that almost the only tradition
preserved in the country mentions that empire as having
had twenty kings who paid tribute to it, as having kept
up an army of five or six million soldiers, and that the
buildings of the royal treasury occupied a space of more
than 300 miles.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In the province still bearing the name of Ongcor, which
is situated eastward of the great lake Touli-Sap, towards
the 14th degree of north lat., and 104° long. east of
Greenwich, there are, on the banks of the Mekon, and
in the ancient kingdom of Tsiampois (Cochin-China), ruins
of such grandeur, remains of structures which must have
been raised at such an immense cost of labour, that, at
the first view, one is filled with profound admiration, and
cannot but ask what has become of this powerful race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
so civilised, so enlightened, the authors of these gigantic
works?</p>

<p class="caption">FAÇADE OF THE TEMPLE OF ONGCOR-WAT.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</div>

<p>One of these temples&mdash;a rival to that of Solomon, and
erected by some ancient Michael Angelo&mdash;might take an
honourable place beside our most beautiful buildings. It
is grander than anything left to us by Greece or Rome,
and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in
which the nation is now plunged.</p>

<p>Unluckily the scourge of war, aided by time, the great
destroyer, who respects nothing, and perhaps also by
earthquakes, has fallen heavily on the greater part of the
other monuments; and the work of destruction and decay
continues among those which still remain standing, imposing
and majestic, amidst the masses of ruins all around.</p>

<p>One seeks in vain for any historical souvenirs of the
many kings who must have succeeded one another on the
throne of the powerful empire of Maha-Nocor-Khmer.
There exists a tradition of a leprous king, to whom is
attributed the commencement of the great temple, but
all else is totally forgotten. The inscriptions, with which
some of the columns are covered, are illegible; and, if you
interrogate the Cambodians as to the founders of Ongcor-Wat,
you invariably receive one of these four replies: “It
is the work of Pra-Eun, the king of the angels;” “It is
the work of the giants;” “It was built by the leprous
king;” or else, “It made itself.”</p>

<p>The work of giants! The expression would be very just,
if used figuratively, in speaking of these prodigious works,
of which no one who has not seen them can form any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
adequate idea; and in the construction of which patience,
strength, and genius appear to have done their utmost in
order to leave to future generations proofs of their power
and civilisation.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that none of these monuments were
intended for habitations; all were temples of Buddhism.
The statues and bas-reliefs, however, curiously enough,
represent entirely secular subjects&mdash;monarchs surrounded
by their wives, their heads and arms loaded with ornaments
such as bracelets and necklaces, the body being
covered with a narrow <i>langouti</i>. On a sort of esplanade
is a statue, said to be that of the leprous king. It is a
little above the middle height, and the prince is seated
in a noble and dignified attitude. The head, particularly,
is a <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>, the features perfectly regular, and possessing
a manly beauty of a description seen now in very
rare instances, and only amongst Cambodians of unmixed
race, living in seclusion at the foot of the mountains, where
the unhealthiness of the climate condemns them to a
solitary existence; or among the savage mountaineers
who occupy the border country separating Siam and Cambodia
from the kingdom of Annam.</p>

<p>This place was probably chosen for the capital on
account of its central position. It is situated fifteen miles
from the great lake, in an arid and sandy plain, although
the banks of the river would appear to have been a preferable
site, more fertile, and offering greater facilities for
communication.</p>

</div>

<p>Although making no pretension whatever either to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
architectural or archæological acquirements, I will endeavour
to describe what I saw, for the benefit of others
interested in these sciences, and, as well as I can, to draw
the attention of Eastern <i>savans</i> to a new scene. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
commence with the temple of Ongcor, the most beautiful
and best preserved of all the remains, and which is
also the first which presents itself to the eye of the traveller,
making him forget all the fatigues of the journey,
filling him with admiration and delight, such as would
be experienced on finding a verdant oasis in the sandy
desert. Suddenly, and as if by enchantment, he seems to
be transported from barbarism to civilisation, from profound
darkness to light.</p>

<p>But, ere I proceed with my description, I must express
my gratitude to the excellent missionary of Battambong,
the Abbé E. Silvestre, who, with exceeding courtesy and
indefatigable energy, accompanied me everywhere, guided
me through the thick forest which covers a portion of
the site of the original building, and by whose assistance
I was enabled to accomplish so much in a limited time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Temple of Ongcor.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">TEMPLE OF ONGCOR.</div>

<p>Before arriving at Ongcor from Battambong, having
previously crossed the great lake from the mouth of either
of the currents which traverse both those localities, you
come upon a stream, which, in the dry season, you ascend
for a couple of miles, and reach a spot where it becomes
somewhat larger, forming a small natural basin, which
serves the purpose of a kind of harbour. From this place
a raised causeway, still passable at the present day, and
extending as far as the limit which the waters attain at
the period of the inundations, that is to say, over a space
of three miles, leads to New Ongcor, an insignificant little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
town, the capital of the province, and situated fifteen
miles to the N.N.W. of the shores of the lake.</p>

<p>If, starting from this point, you follow for about a
couple of hours in the same direction a dusty sandy
path passing through a dense forest of stunted trees; and
having also frequently crossed the river, which is exceedingly
sinuous in its course, you will arrive at an esplanade
about 9 metres wide by 27 long, parallel to the building.
At each angle, at the extremity of the two longer sides,
are two enormous lions, sculptured out of the rock, and
forming, with the pedestals, only a single block. Four
large flights of steps lead to the platform.</p>

<p>From the north staircase, which faces the principal
entrance, you skirt, in order to reach the latter, a causeway
230 metres in length by 9 in width, covered or paved
with large slabs of stone, and supported by walls of great
thickness. This causeway crosses a ditch 220 metres
wide, which surrounds the building; the revetment,
3 metres high by 1 metre thick, is formed of ferruginous
stone, with the exception of the top row, which is
of freestone, each block being of the same thickness as the
wall.</p>

<p class="caption">PRINCIPAL ENTRANCE OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF ONGCOR WAT.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Principal Entrance.</i>&mdash;The edifice forms a long gallery
with a central tower, and two others, of rather less altitude,
about 30 metres distant from the former. The
portico of each tower is formed of four projecting columns,
with a staircase. At each extremity are similar porticoes,
beyond which, but immediately contiguous thereto, is a
high door or gateway, on the same level, which serves for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the passage of vehicles. From constant use the wheels
have worn two deep ruts in the massive flagstones with
which the ground is paved.</p>

<p>Upon the west side the gallery is supported by two rows
of square columns; on the east, blank windows have been
let into the wall, with stone railings or balconies of twisted
columns 14 centimetres in diameter. The whole of this
side, within one metre of the ground, and half a metre
of the cornice, is covered with sculptures executed with
marvellously artistic skill.</p>

<p>The roof&mdash;and in this respect it resembles all the
other buildings&mdash;is a double one, constructed externally
of sculptured stone, the blocks in the interior being plain;
they were formerly hidden by a ceiling, also sculptured,
of which some remains may still be remarked. The
edifice divides the wall into two equal parts; upon the
other sides, and facing the monument, are three pavilions,
33 metres in length.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">TEMPLE OF ONGCOR WAT, NORTH SIDE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This imposing colonnade, which, from its great length
and beautiful proportions, attracts the attention from a
distance, forms a fitting entrance to the great monument.</p>

<p><i>The Temple.</i>&mdash;Commencing from the building which
forms the principal entrance, is a second causeway,
9 metres wide by 342 metres in length; it is raised
1 metre from the level of the ground. It is covered with
huge blocks of stone, carefully joined together throughout
its entire length, and is surrounded by a balustrade, partially
in ruins, about 10 centimetres high, composed of
long stones, with bevelled edges, very massive, and covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
with sculptures. On each side are six platforms of earth,
ascended by several steps, upon each of which is a serpent
with seven heads, some erect, others thrown back.</p>

<p>In the centre of the causeway are two elegant pavilions,
one on each side, having at each extremity a portico
33 metres 66 centimetres in length. At the end of the
causeway, and at the foot of the terrace, are, on each side
of the latter, two ponds or sheets of water. A balustrade,
like that of the causeway, and resting like it upon a
sculptured basement, springs from the foot of the terrace,
and runs all round the monument. At certain intervals
there are large staircases of several steps each.</p>

<p><i>The Terrace.</i>&mdash;The terrace is 2 metres 30 centimetres
in height, and is surrounded by 112 fluted columns, surmounted
by capitals, formed in each case of one single
block of stone. The basement, like that of the whole
building, is ornamented with very beautiful sculptured
cornices, varied in style, and entirely covered with delicate
carvings representing roses and arabesques, worked
with the chisel, with a taste and skill equally wonderful.</p>

<p>This terrace forms a cross, each arm of which is 122
metres in length, and 12 metres 16 centimetres wide.
There are three flights of steps, upon each of which are
four lions reclining upon their pedestals.</p>

<p><i>The Portico.</i>&mdash;This is 6 metres in length, and is supported
by six columns, four of which are detached from
the monument.</p>

<p>The temple is formed of three distinct parts raised in
the form of terraces one above the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Galleries.</i>&mdash;The galleries form a rectangle, the
façade of which is 180 metres in length; the sides 216
metres 16 centimetres by 4 metres 16 centimetres.</p>

<p>The vaulted ceilings of the galleries are raised 6 metres
from the ground; those of the second roof are 4 metres
30 centimetres high. The two roofs are supported by
a double row of columns, the first being 3 metres 18 centimetres
and the second 2 metres 25 centimetres high by
48 centimetres broad. The columns are square, and, like
all other buildings in the province, are formed of single
blocks.</p>

<p>There are five staircases on the west side, the same
number on the east, and three on each of the remaining
sides.</p>

<p>The basement is 3 metres 90 centimetres in height,
the length externally forming a terrace of 1 metre 67
centimetres.</p>

<p>Each portico is composed of three roofs raised one
above the other, which contribute materially to give to
the architecture of these long galleries a monumental
appearance, producing a singularly beautiful effect.</p>

<p>The opposite side of the wall to the double colonnade
is, from the lowest row of cornices to one metre above its
base, covered inside with bas-reliefs, having externally
blank windows with balustrades.</p>

<div><p class="caption">CARVINGS OF ARMS, UTENSILS, AND ORNAMENTS, AT ONGCOR-WAT</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are two rows of cornices, the first part immediately
above the columns; and the space, to the extent
of nearly one metre, which lies between them, is filled up
by roses and other sculptured designs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BAS-RELIEFS.</div>

<p>The bas-reliefs represent the combat of the king of the
apes with the king of the angels:<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in the centre is the
king of the angels, drawn by two griffins; he has seven
heads and twenty arms, with a sabre in each hand. Some
of the chiefs are seated in cars drawn by fabulous animals,
while others are mounted on elephants. The soldiers are
armed with bows, javelins, or sabres, but the apes have
generally no weapons except their formidable claws: a
few of them have clubs, sabres, or branches of trees.</p>

<p><i>Peristyle No. 1.</i>&mdash;Here is represented the march of
warriors mounted on birds, horses, tigers, and fabulous
animals; the horses of the chiefs are led by the bridle.
On the right the soldiers are advancing towards the scene
of combat in the centre; but here there are no fantastic
animals.</p>

<p><i>Peristyle No. 2.</i>&mdash;The bas-reliefs of this peristyle represent
the combat between the king of the apes and the
king of the angels, and the death of the former. Close by
is a boat filled with rowers, all with long beards, and some
of them attired in the Chinese fashion: the group is
admirable for the natural positions and for the expression
given to the faces. A cock-fight, and women at play
with their children, are also represented. It is in these
bas-reliefs that the highest degree of skill is shown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Other subjects follow, the meaning of which I could not
discover.</p>

<p>On the south side, to the left hand, is a military procession&mdash;bodies
of soldiers headed by chiefs, some mounted
on elephants, others on horseback, and each corps carrying
different arms, lances, halberds, javelins, sabres, and bows.
On the right are two series, one representing the Hindu
Paradise Swarga, the other the Hindu infernal regions
Naralma. A crowd of persons are entering Paradise, and
are received in palanquins: they have with them banners,
fans, parasols, and boxes for holding betel, without which
even Paradise would not be perfect happiness to a Cambodian.</p>

<p>A triumphal march. Paradise.&mdash;The elect seated on a
magnificent dais, surrounded by a great number of women,
with caskets and fans in their hands, while the men are
holding flowers and have children on their knees. These
appear to be all the joys of Paradise.</p>

<p>The punishments of the infernal regions, on the contrary,
are varied and numerous; and while the elect, who
are enjoying themselves in Paradise, are all fat and plump,
the poor condemned beings are so lean that their bones
show through their skin, and the expression of their faces
is pitiful and full of a most comic seriousness. Some are
being pounded in mortars, while others hold them by the
feet and hands; some are being sawn asunder; others
are led along, like buffaloes, with ropes through their
noses. In other places the <i>comphubal</i> (executioners) are
cutting men to pieces with sabres; while a crowd of poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
wretches are being transfixed by the tusks of elephants, or
on the horns of rhinoceros. Fabulous animals are busy
devouring some; others are in irons, and have had their
eyes put out.</p>

<p>In the centre sits the judge with his ministers, all sabre
in hand, and the guilty are dragged before them by the
hair or feet. In the distance is visible a furnace and
another crowd of people under punishment, being tortured
in divers ways&mdash;impaled, roasted on spits, tied to trees
and pierced with arrows, suspended with heavy weights
attached to their hands and feet, devoured by dogs or
vultures, or crucified with nails through their bodies.</p>

<p>These bas-reliefs are perfect; the rest are inferior in
workmanship and expression.</p>

<p>On the east side, a number of men, divided into two
equal groups, are represented as attempting to drag in
contrary directions the great serpent or dragon with seven
heads, while, in the centre, an angel stands looking on.
Many angels are seen floating in the sky above, while
fishes, aquatic animals, and marine monsters swim about
in a sea visible beneath. The angel is seated on the
celebrated mountain of Thibet, Pra Soumer, and in
different places angels with several heads give assistance
to those pulling the serpent. The king of the apes, Sdach
Soa, appears also here.</p>

<p>To the right is a military procession and a combat,
the chiefs being mounted on elephants, unicorns, griffins,
eagles with peacocks’ tails, and other fantastic animals,
while winged dragons draw the cars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>On the northern side is portrayed a combat, and procession,
with drums, flutes, trumpets, tam-tams, and organs
said to be Chinese; a king, mounted on the shoulders of
a hideous giant, who holds in each hand by the foot a
fighting giant. All the chiefs take part in the combat,
standing, some on tigers, others in cars.</p>

<p>Near the central peristyle is a figure of the king, with
a long beard; on each side are courtiers with clasped
hands.</p>

<p>To the right appears a military procession, a combat,
griffins, eagles with peacocks’ tails, a dragon with seven
heads and a tower on his back&mdash;the king letting fly an
arrow, standing on the back of a giant with tail, claws,
and beak.</p>

<p><i>Second Story.</i>&mdash;The first gallery on the west side is
connected with the second by two other smaller galleries,
40 metres long, and which are themselves connected by
two colonnades in the form of a cross, and supporting two
vaulted roofs.</p>

<p>Four rows of square columns, each hewn out of a single
block of stone, those in the inside row being 4 metres
14 centimetres high and 45 centimetres thick; those on
the outside being 3 metres 10 centimetres high, and
rather smaller at the top than at the base. The little
gallery on the right is filled with statues representing
persons in the act of worshipping idols, some of these
being of wood, others of stone. Many of the statues are
4 metres in height, and the greater number of them must
be of great age, to judge from their state of dilapidation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
in spite of the hardness of the stone. In the centre is
a statue of the famous leprous king, and by his side, in a
posture of adoration, are two statues of priests, with faces
full of expression. These are real chefs-d’œuvre. At no
great distance is a small statue of his queen.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are found two pavilions of extremely elegant
architecture, with porticoes and staircases at each end.</p>

<p>There is a second gallery, with four towers at each
end and three porticoes and staircases on each side. This
gallery is raised on a base 5 metres 10 centimetres
high, the ledge of which forms a terrace 74 centimetres
broad.</p>

<p>There are neither columns nor bas-reliefs here, but
the walls have imitation windows with twisted bars; the
gallery is half dark, receiving very little light except
through the doors. There are idols, both of stone and
bronze, on pedestals, with their hands held out to receive
gifts from their worshippers.</p>

<p class="caption"><a id="CENTRAL_PORTICO_OF_THE_GREAT_TEMPLE_OF_ONGCOR-WAT"></a>CENTRAL PORTICO OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF ONGCOR-WAT.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Central part.</i>&mdash;A raised terrace leads to the foot of the
great staircase, and forms a cross, the arms of which lead
to two small pavilions with four porticoes and staircases.
The base of this part is admirably executed, both as to
general effect and in detail. There are twelve staircases,
the four in the middle being 6 metres wide, and having
39 steps.</p>

<p>The building forms a square, each side of which is
56 metres 60 centimetres, and at each angle is a tower. A
central tower, larger and higher, is connected with the
lateral galleries by colonnades covered, like the galleries,
with a double roof; and both galleries and colonnades are
supported on a base one metre from the floor of the
interior courts.</p>

<p>Opposite each of the twelve staircases is a small
portico with four columns, 4 metres 50 centimetres high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and 47 centimetres in diameter. Windows, similar in
form and dimension to those of the other galleries, are
on each side, and have twisted bars carved in stone.</p>

<p>In front of each colonnade, with an entrance in the
tower, is a dark and narrow chapel, to which there is an
ascent of eight steps. These four chapels do not communicate
with each other. Each contains an idol 4 metres
in height, sculptured in the solid wall, at whose feet is
another nearly 2 metres long, representing Samanakodom
sleeping. The central tower is 33 metres high from the
pavement of the gallery, and 50 from the basement of the
building.</p>

<p>What strikes the observer with not less admiration than
the grandeur, regularity, and beauty of these majestic
buildings, is the immense size and prodigious number of
the blocks of stone of which they are constructed. In this
temple alone are as many as 1532 columns. What means
of transport, what a multitude of workmen, must this have
required, seeing that the mountain out of which the stone
was hewn is thirty miles distant! In each block are to
be seen holes 2&frac12; centimetres in diameter and 3 in depth,
the number varying with the size of the blocks; but the
columns and the sculptured portions of the building bear
no traces of them. According to a Cambodian legend,
these are the prints of the fingers of a giant, who, after
kneading an enormous quantity of clay, had cut it into
blocks and carved it, turning it into a hard and, at the
same time, light stone by pouring over it some marvellous
liquid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">RUINS IN ONGCOR.</div>

<p>All the mouldings, sculptures, and bas-reliefs appear
to have been executed after the erection of the building.
The stones are everywhere fitted together in so perfect a
manner that you can scarcely see where are the joinings;
there is neither sign of mortar nor mark of the chisel,
the surface being as polished as marble. Was this incomparable
edifice the work of a single genius, who conceived
the idea, and watched over the execution of it? One is
tempted to think so; for no part of it is deficient, faulty,
or inconsistent. To what epoch does it owe its origin?
As before remarked, neither tradition nor written inscriptions
furnish any certain information upon this point; or
rather, I should say, these latter are as a sealed book
for want of an interpreter; and they may, perchance,
throw light on the subject when some European savant
shall succeed in deciphering them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ruins in the Province of Ongcor. Mount Bakhêng.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">RUINS IN ONGCOR.</div>

<p>A temple, about 100 metres in height, built of limestone
has been erected on the top of Mount Bakhêng,
which is situated two miles and a half north of Ongcor-Wat,
on the road leading to the town. At the foot of
the mountain are to be seen, among the trees, two magnificent
lions, 20 centimetres in height, and each formed,
with the pedestals, out of a single block. Steps, partly
destroyed, lead to the top of the mountain, whence is to
be enjoyed a view so beautiful and extensive, that it is
not surprising that these people, who have shown so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
much taste in their buildings, should have chosen it for
a site.</p>

<p>On the one side you gaze upon the wooded plain and
the pyramidal temple of Ongcor, with its rich colonnades,
the mountain of Crome, which is beyond the new city,
the view losing itself in the waters of the great lake on
the horizon. On the opposite side stretches the long chain
of mountains whose quarries, they say, furnished the
beautiful stone used for the temples; and amidst thick
forests, which extend along the base, is a pretty, small
lake, which looks like a blue ribbon on a carpet of verdure.
All this region is now as lonely and deserted as
formerly it must have been full of life and cheerfulness;
and the howling of wild animals, and the cries of a few
birds, alone disturb the solitude.</p>

<p>Sad fragility of human things! How many centuries
and thousands of generations have passed away, of which
history, probably, will never tell us anything: what riches
and treasures of art will remain for ever buried beneath
these ruins; how many distinguished men&mdash;artists, sovereigns,
and warriors&mdash;whose names were worthy of immortality,
are now forgotten, laid to rest under the thick dust
which covers these tombs!</p>

<p>The whole summit of the mountain is covered with
a coating of lime, forming a vast smooth surface. At
regular intervals are four rows of deep holes, in some of
which still stand the columns that formerly supported
two roofs, and formed a gallery leading from the staircase
to the principal part of the building, and the transverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
branches of which were connected with four towers, built
partly of stone, partly of brick. Judging from the details
of the work, and the state of the stone, which in many
places crumbles at a touch, this building belongs to a
period much anterior to that of many of the other monuments.
Art, like science, was then in its infancy;
difficulties were surmounted, but not without great efforts
of labour and intelligence; taste was of a grand description,
but genius was not in proportion; in a word, the
temple of Mount Bakhêng appears to have been the
prelude to civilization, while that of Ongcor-Wat was
probably its climax.</p>

<p>In the two towers, which are least dilapidated, and
which the modern worshippers have covered with a
thatched roof, the old one having fallen in, are large idols
rudely fashioned, and bearing marks of great age. In
one of the other towers is a large stone, the inscription on
which is still visible; and on the exterior wall is carved
the figure of a king with a long beard, the only portion of
bas-relief remaining.</p>

<p>A wall surrounds the top of the mountain. Bakhêng
has also its Phrâbat, but it is a facsimile of recent origin.
The building is quadrangular, and composed of five stories,
each 3 metres high. That at the base is 68 metres
square. They form so many terraces, which serve as bases
to seventy-two small but elegant pavilions; and they are
enriched with mouldings, colonnades, and cornices, but no
sculpture. The work is perfect; and from its good state
of preservation would seem to be of a more recent date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
than the towers. It is evident that each of these little
pavilions formerly contained an idol.</p>

<p>Each side of the square has a staircase 2 metres wide,
with nine steps to each story, and lions on each terrace.
The centre of the terrace formed by the last story is only
a confused mass of ruins from the fallen towers. Near
the staircase are two gigantic blocks of very fine stone,
as polished as marble, and shaped like pedestals for
statues.</p>

<h3>Charles the Bold.</h3>

<p class="p2 center">HISTORY OF CHARLES THE BOLD,
DUKE OF BURGUNDY.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">By</span> JOHN FOSTER KIRK.</p>

<p class="p2 center">With Portrait. 2 Vols. 8vo. 30<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Kirk has produced a work which is quite entitled to rank with the writings of
his two predecessors (Mr. Prescott and Mr. Motley), with whom he has, both in his merits
and his faults, a certain family resemblance. He has studied his subject, not only with
patient industry, but with that strong sense of its pre-eminent interest and importance
which seems almost disproportionate to a bystander, but which helps him to see and
understand much that an equally learned but less enthusiastic student might have overlooked.
His extensive and minute knowledge is the learning of a man of vigorous thought
accustomed to bring his mind to consider men and things, not merely as they have been
written about, but as they actually were, in the variety and complexity of their real
existence.”&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“The student of mediæval history has presented to him in these volumes the history of
a very striking character, who flourished in an age full of interest, as being the last of
those which are commonly called the Middle Ages; a character whose salient points stand
out all the more prominently from the contrast which they afford to the features, hardly
less strongly marked, of his royal antagonist, Louis XI. The author’s graphic and picturesque
style will interest the lover of history.”&mdash;<i>English Churchman.</i></p>

<p>“As the pupil, friend, and collaborateur of Prescott, Mr. Kirk was early initiated into
those methods of patient analysis and careful collation, which, conjoined with a remarkably
transparent style, give such value to the works of that historian. He does not present us
with a mere compilation from works already published, he has conscientiously, and with
indefatigable industry, explored the archives of the various countries in which the life
story of his hero was acted out, and from these stores he has selected a mass of original
matter, from which he has been enabled to reproduce the whole epoch in its minutest as
well as in its broadest features. The style of Mr. Kirk is as clear as crystal and sometimes
as brilliant. The subject of the work is worthy of such a writer and thinker. The age
of Charles the Bold, as the culminating period of the feudal system, contains for us of the
present day a profound interest. Mr. Kirk’s exemplification of the working of these
antagonistic forces is full of instruction and exceeds in real interest and in startling
incidents any fictitious work with which we are acquainted. A third volume, which is to
appear shortly, will complete a history, which for original research, excellence of arrangement,
beauty of execution, and the impartial spirit that pervades it, is worthy of a place
by the side of Prescott’s ‘Ferdinand and Isabella.’”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“These volumes have no confined and merely learned interest. They are creditable
to the information, research, and thought of the writers, but not less to their power of
clear teaching. They have acquainted themselves with recent researches and discoveries;
but the Dictionary must prove an invaluable help to the scriptural student, whether
lay or clerical, since it presents, in a form sufficiently popular without being superficial,
an immense amount of serviceable information, and very necessary to the understanding
of the Bible. The mass of information, indeed, collected in these volumes is so considerable,
that an ordinary reader might be at first alarmed at the idea of the labour
required to master it; while, further, the references to the special works on particular
topics open up fields of research which in many cases it would need a long and close
application to occupy. But the form of the work relieves the difficulty. The reader may
choose for himself his own line of study, every point in which will be something gained in
his knowledge, in the most natural and agreeable manner.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

appears for the first time; I have to remark that it is probably derived
from, or of common origin with, the Pharaoh of antiquity. It is
given in the Siamese dictionaries as synonymous with God, ruler,
priest, and teacher. It is in fact the word by which sovereignty and
sanctity are associated in the popular mind. As the title Divus was
appropriated by the Roman Emperor, as in most monarchies a sort
of sacredness is attached to the royal person, the orientals have made
gods of their kings, their heroes, and their sages, without any scruple.
Image-worship is in fact only the materialising or incarnating of the
idea of Deity.”&mdash;<i>The Kingdom and People of Siam</i>, Sir John Bowring.</p></div>
